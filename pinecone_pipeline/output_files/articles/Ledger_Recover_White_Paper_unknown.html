      We are pleased to share the now-published
      <a href="https://github.com/LedgerHQ/recover-whitepaper">
       Ledger Recover Cryptographic Protocol White Paper
      </a>
      for review.
     </p>
     <p>
      In our ongoing effort to build in a transparent and collaborative way, we are publishing the detailed technical White Paper on Ledger Recover, provided by Coincover. This document covers the system design, architecture, and operational flows of
      <a href="https://www.ledger.com/recover">
       Ledger Recover, our advanced solution for backing up and restoring the Ledger device’s Secret Recovery Phrase
      </a>
      . As a reminder, Ledger Recover is an entirely optional and opt-in paid subscription service that does not impact the security of your Ledger.
     </p>
     <p>
      In this white paper, you will find thorough coverage of Ledger Recover’s system design, the cryptographic protocol design and security goals, as well as details on the three primary operational flows:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Backing up your Secret Recovery Phrase
      </li>
      <li>
       Restoring it on a new Ledger device
      </li>
      <li>
       Securely deleting your backups
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>

      While this White Paper focuses on the technical aspects of the Ledger Recover cryptographic protocol, provided by Coincover, there is much more we want to share with you. We will soon publish a series of blog posts called
      <strong>
       The Genesis of Ledger Recover
      </strong>
      , written by different leaders in this project. This series will go further into our design choices, the thinking process behind this project, operational security features, as well as an in-depth look at our product’s security reviews conducted throughout the development of Ledger Recover.
     </p>
     <p>
      This upcoming blog series will be structured as follows:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Part One
       </strong>
       : How we split the Secret Recovery Phrase: An introduction to Shamir Secret Sharing
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Part Two
       </strong>
       : Secure distribution of shares: End-to-End Secure Channels
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Part Three
       </strong>
       : Collusion and leak countermeasures using multiple layers of encryption
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Part Four
       </strong>
       : How we handle authentication before recovery - the secure use of Identity Verification
      </li>
      <li>

        Part Five
       </strong>
       : An overview of our operational security, both in terms of hardening our infrastructure and securing manual claims processes
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Part Six
       </strong>
       : Security reviews and audits performed to ensure the security of the service
