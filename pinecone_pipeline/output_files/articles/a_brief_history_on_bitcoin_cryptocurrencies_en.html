      Bitcoin
     </a>
     emerged as the first cryptocurrency. A lot has happened since that day – let’s to take a look back at the history of cryptocurrency to understand the important changes it catalyzed.

    The History of Bitcoin: From The Start
   </h2>
   <p>
    The idea of having a digital currency is not a new one. Prior to
    <a aria-label="cryptocurrencies (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQEkdu6zT_A" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     cryptocurrencies
    </a>
    , many attempts at creating one have taken place. The main issue most of them were facing, was the double spending problem. A digital asset somehow needs to be usable only once to prevent copying it and effectively counterfeiting it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Over 10 years before cryptocurrencies, the concept had been introduced by computer engineer Wei Dai. In 1998, he published a paper where he discussed “B-money”. He discussed the idea of a digital currency, which could be sent along a group of untraceable digital pseudonyms. That same year, another attempt by the name of Bit Gold was drafted by blockchain pioneer
    <a aria-label=" (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Szabo" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     Nick Szabo
    </a>
    . Bit Gold equally looked into creating a decentralized digital currency. Szabo’s idea was spurred by inefficiencies within the traditional financial system, such as requiring metal to create coins and to reduce the amount of trust needed to create transactions. While both were never officially launched, they were part of the inspiration behind Bitcoin.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    The Birth of Bitcoin: The First Cryptocurrency

   <p>
    Satoshi Nakamoto published the

    called

    </em>
    , describing the functionality of the Bitcoin blockchain network. This day in Bitcoin history has carved the path for the events that followed.
   </p>
   <p>
    Four months later, Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity remains a mystery to this day, mined the first block of the Bitcoin network, effectively piloting the
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-blockchain" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">

    . The first mined block is also known as the Genesis Block.
   </p>
   <p>
    The first recorded purchase of goods was made with Bitcoin when Laszlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas for 10,000 BTC. This day is still commemorated to date as the
    <strong>
     Bitcoin Pizza Day
    </strong>
    . At Ledger, we celebrated this with a

    How The Crypto Market Made History
   </h2>
   <p>
    After the birth of Bitcoin as the first cryptocurrency, solutions had to be found in order to trade them. In March 2010, the first cryptocurrency exchange appeared in the name of bitcoinmarket.com (now defunct). In July that year, Mt.Gox was launched as well.
   </p>
   <p>
    From 2011 to 2013, Bitcoin managed to reach parity with the US Dollar in February. During this year, a few rivaling cryptocurrencies emerged: By May 2013, the cryptocurrency market counted 10 digital assets, including Litecoin. Another major crypto asset joined in August in the name of XRP (Ripple).

    The Mt.Gox Disaster
   </h3>
   <p>
    As the value of Bitcoin grew, the first hacks followed. In June 2011, Mt.Gox got hacked for the first time: 2,000 BTC was stolen, having a value of around $30,000 at the time.
   </p>
   <p>
    Mt.Gox became the largest cryptocurrency exchange in 2013, at its peak handling 70% of all Bitcoin transactions.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unfortunately, in 2014, Mt.Gox became the

     first major cryptocurrency exchange hack
    </a>
    , having 850,000 BTC stolen from it. This is the largest theft of BTC in Bitcoin history, which was valued at $460,000,000 at the time (current date value around  $9,5 billion).
   </p>
   <p>
    After this unprecedented situation, the
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/coin/price/bitcoin" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     Bitcoin price
    </a>
    plummeted by 50% and did not recover to its initial value till late 2016. Cryptocurrency exchange hacks have remained ever-present since, though rarely of Mt.Gox’s caliber.
