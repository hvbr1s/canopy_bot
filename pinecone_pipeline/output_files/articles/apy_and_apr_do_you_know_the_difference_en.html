     APY and APR come from traditional finance – but they are also essential knowledge for anyone using DeFi!
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    Whether you’re lending, borrowing or growing your savings account, finance has one common theme – we’re all aiming to have a little more. In times gone by, this meant a trip to the bank, a new file full of paperwork and likely, a nice profit for the bank itself.
   </p>
   <p>
    But blockchain changed that. By providing a trustless system, where transactions could be guaranteed without any middleman, leaving in place an ecosystem where just about anyone can access a new array of options without even leaving their home.
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-defi" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     DeFi’s
    </a>
    accessibility is what makes it so revolutionary.
   </p>
   <p>
    Two of the most important – and confusing –  terms you’ll see in DeFi are APY and APR. These two acronyms are used so interchangeably that many people aren’t even aware that they are, in fact, two different things. Both Annual Percentage Rate (APR) and Annual Percentage Yield (APY) measure how much interest you earn from your deposits, but they do so in different ways.
   </p>
   <p>
    Here we will explore how knowing the difference can help you better understand and calculate potential – and risk – across traditional and decentralized finance.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    DeFi Passive Income Options
   </h2>
   <p>
    One of the most attractive aspects of decentralized finance is the opportunities it offers for making passive income on your crypto.
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-yield-farming" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     Yield farming
    </a>
    via liquidity pools and
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/basic-basics/keep-growing-it/stake-your-crypto" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     staking
    </a>
    are two of the most common ways to generate passive income in the DeFi space.
   </p>
   <p>
    These options offer high returns, but they also pose a higher risk environment than traditional finance: a lot can happen while your cryptocurrency is locked up, so being aware of the risks you might face is key to choosing wisely. Luckily, the financial system has a sort of clever short-hand that allows you to assess opportunities at a glance; this takes the form of APY and APR, and here, we’ll show you how to interpret these.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    What are APY and APR?
   </h2>
   <p>
    In basic terms, APY and APR are metrics that express the returns on your investment, and you’ll see them a lot in DeFi. But they are not the same – so in order to make an informed assessment of the opportunities available to you (and understand the risk the figures are expressing), you’ll need to understand exactly how each one is calculated. Let’s deal with APR first.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    APR Explained
   </h3>
   <p>
    APR (Annual Percentage Rate) is a common measurement used by banks when presenting loan options to clients,cand you’ll also find it in DeFi.
   </p>
   <p>
    APR is the interest rate you’ll earn per year on your sum. The defining feature of this measure is how that interest is calculated: it’s a function of the principal sum only, and does not take into account interest already earned on the same sum.
    <strong>
     <em>
     </em>
    </strong>
    Let’s show that using an example.
   </p>
   <p>
    Say you make your crypto (equal in value to 10,000 USD) available for a loan for three years, and it has a return of 5% APR.
   </p>
   <p>
    Each year, you will make a return of 5% of the original sum loaned – in this case, 500 USD. So by the end of a three-year investment, you will have made 1500 USD, and you’ll also have your original sum back too.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    APY Explained
   </h3>
   <p>
    APY (Annual Percentage Yield) is the interest rate that you receive on an investment when both the
    <em>
     principal sum
    </em>
    and the
    <em>
     interest on that sum
    </em>
    are compounded.
   </p>
   <p>
    Let’s look at an example. Say you make an investment of 10,000 USD for three years and it has a return of 5% APY. The compounding period – the frequency at which the interest is recalculated – is every 12 months.
   </p>
   <p>
    Each 12 months, you’ll make 5% interest on
    <em>
     both
    </em>
    the original sum paid
    <em>
     and
    </em>
    the interest itself.
   </p>
   <p>
    Year 1: 5% of 10,000 = 500.00
   </p>
   <p>
    Year 2: 5% of 10,500 = 525.00
   </p>
   <p>
    Year 3: 5% of 11,025 = 551.25
   </p>
   <p>
    Here, for the exact same sum and interest rate, you would have made 1576.25 USD in yield. This is because the calculation included both the principal sum and the interest accruing on that sum. Therefore, APY
    <em>
     assumes
    </em>
    through its calculation that you will deposit both your principal sum AND the yield on it back into the same protocol at the end of the compounding period.
   </p>
   <p>
    The result? The reward is attractive BUT assumes a greater degree of commitment to the project on your part, and this is something that needs to be borne in mind.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Risks Associated with DeFi Passive Income
   </h2>
   <p>
    DeFi presents unprecedented freedom – and to an extent, unprecedented rewards – for users. But it also comes with risks: liquidity pool users may stand to make substantial rewards, but their locked liquidity may be subject to

    How to Do Your Own Research (DYOR)

    Beyond checking the returns offered by a given DeFi project, there are other resources you can refer to in order to build a picture of the project you’re interacting with.
