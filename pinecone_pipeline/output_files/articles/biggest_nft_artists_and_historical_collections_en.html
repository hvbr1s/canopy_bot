     NFTs are a the blockchain-powered tour de force that took art by storm in 2021. But who are the key names driving the movement, and why?
    </em>
    <em>
     Here, we present the biggest NFT artists.
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    The NFT space offers a totally different way to approach art. With a blockchain-enabled ecosystem, NFTs have created a cultural movement, appealing to a community that’s building up itself. Unlike other scenes, the NFT space, decentralized from any industry authorities, is driven by a highly engaged, dispersed community that plays a massive role in giving momentum to the artists.
   </p>
   <p>
    It might be difficult to know where to turn if you’re not aware of the pillars, but by getting to know the foundation that makes the space (that is, the artists), you’re setting yourself up to
    <em>
     really
    </em>
    get a feel for NFTs – and what drives their community. In this article, we’ll go through the proverbial gallery of the most popular artists in the NFT space, exploring ten of the top-valued artists in the NFT market (in no particular order).
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Pak
   </h2>
   <p>
    We would be remiss to begin anywhere else. The anonymous Pak may be a crypto artist, but beyond that, he or she is an experimental innovator who is constantly seeking to challenge our perceptions via emerging technology. With an identity shrouded in mystery, we don’t know the historical background of the digital artist. What we do know is that they’re behind the studio Undream and AI visual media curator Archillect, and it’s for certain: Pak has become one of the most interesting, game-changing artists to emerge in the space and to make a success of their art in the NFT realm.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    What Makes Pak So Interesting?
   </h3>
   <p>
    Pak’s prominence comes from a particular flavour of art: There’s an element of irreverence in what they create and how they market their work. One collection, “
    <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://niftygateway.com/collections/thetitle" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     The Title
    </a>
    ” features nine
    <em>
     identical pieces,
    </em>
    each with only two differences: The name, and the price. Yep, the same artwork sold at different values. It gives you insight into how Pak plays with the idea of value and pinpoints exactly how art is more than just art. It’s a representation of influence, culture, community and an industry that can market itself if done right. And Pak has consistently managed to get it right with their unusual ways of engaging with different mechanics. It’s a weird and wonderful way of unpacking the way people fall for hype around art – and an artist – and packs it in a neat bundle of discovery into what art is and how a collection can represent a whole lot more than just art.
   </p>
   <p>
    Pak’s most famous collection was launched in April in collaboration with Sotheby’s. It began when Pak took to Twitter
    <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/muratpak/status/1346491389245353985" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     calling on auction houses
    </a>
    to offer them a gift.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was enigmatic and Sotheby’s stepped up to the plate, as unknown as it was. It led to a three-day auction of ‘The Fungible
    <em>
     ‘
    </em>
    , the collection that saw a massive $17 million come in.
   </p>
   <p>
    Pak’s twist on art and value was further highlighted with the
    <em>
     Lost Poets
    </em>
    collection. Selling what looked like a blank page, Pak’s
    <em>
     Lost Poets
    </em>
    went for 0.32 ETH, an amount that doubled over a weekend and has led to a $70 million sale overall. The beauty of the
    <em>
     Lost Poets
    </em>
    is that the page filled with art only when it was minted. Pak also rewarded those who bought the most pages with additional ones. The move is almost a nod to those who put their trust in the potential work and it’s played out stunningly for the collectors.
    <br/>

    The latest to drop,
    <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://niftygateway.com/collections/pakmerge" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     <em>
      The Merge
     </em>
    </a>
    has just closed its public sale and the mechanic is (as is a Pak classic) unusual. Built with increasing scarcity, the collection encourages collectors to buy more tokens for the artwork (mass) and each time they buy mass, it adds up automatically (or it “merges”). The more mass owned, the bigger their NFT will be visually. It’s like a puzzle and the more pieces collectors invest in, the bigger their picture is. The massive success of this series (it has gathered close to $100 million in sales) made Pak the most valuable art creator of today.

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GG5QL1jHfU&amp;t=16s" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">

    Beeple’s Work
   </h3>
   <p>
    His most famous NFT work,
    <em>
     Everydays – The First 5000 Days,
    </em>
    features a collage of the work that he’s created. Every. Single. Day. Since the beginning. It sold through an auction at Christie’s for a staggering $69 million, making him among the three most valuable living artists today.
   </p>
   <p>
    Recently, Beeple’s
    <em>
     Human One
    </em>
    went for $29 million at a Christie’s auction. While the sale amount is still enough to make the eyes water, it’s not the most important element here: the piece itself is setting a new precedent in how interactive and dynamic NFT art can be.
    <em>
     Human One
    </em>
    shows an astronaut walking around in a glass box with a digitally programmed dystopian setting that changes depending on location, time, and global or local events. As things unfold, Beeple can reprogram the background to a completely different setting. It gives the piece the potential to act as an almost constant line of communication between the art and the audience. It means that the buyer didn’t
    <em>
     just
    </em>
    buy the NFT. Rather, they bought an art piece that connects them to the artist in a way like never before.

   <p>
    Like Pak, we don’t
    <em>
     actually
    </em>
    know who the artist is behind XCOPY’s art. The anonymous London-based artist takes a dystopian style to their digital art exploring the darker themes using distorted visual loops. XCOPY has become an iconic figure in the crypto space with the art featured on SuperRare from the launch on the platform (making them an OG in the cryptocurrency art space).

   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    XCopy’s Two-Part Iconic Style
   </h3>
   <p>
    What gives XCOPY’s work the XCOPY factor lies in the specific style they use with motion. The illustrations themselves have a rough-around-the-edges trademark flavour, emphasising the dystopian theme, but the animation they use really brings this to life. XCOPY’s art adds the digital dynamic to digital art, with the flashing pixels painting a portrait of the path art can take.
   </p>
   <p>
    Right now, XCOPY’s work is valued at $53,699,755.65 with

   <p>
    FEWOCiOUS – Victor Langlois – was not even a fully-fledged adult when he started selling his art, with his first piece selling when he was just 17.
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE5A0diDhO4&amp;t=1s">
     His art is inspired by a complicated upbringing and a battle with identity
    </a>
    . Art became a sanctuary that Victor could find safety behind and his art is emotion at the heart of it. FEWOCiOUS represents the story of success through adversity, it’s a hero tale unfolding and the art is one of the key ingredients to the charm.
   </p>
   <p>
    Before he minted his artworks, the highest selling piece he sold went for $90 (and
    <em>
     fun fact,
    </em>
    that collector advised him to sell his work as NFTs). His first minted NFT went for $1500. Just a few days later, his work had increased in value by over 10 times his first NFT sale.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now, at only 18, FEWOCiOUS stands as the third top-selling NFT artists.
   </p>
   <p>
    With the enthusiasm of a young artist and the massive potential of a prodigy, we wouldn’t be surprised if FEWOCiOUS is a name taught in art school for years to come.

     “Born amongst the communities of the web, a place where space and time no longer exist, “geographically agnostic”, where creators can stay anonymous, being judged only for their art, and where these judges are no longer a handful of experts selected by hierarchies.”
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    So speaks the bio page of artist duo Hackatao. The game behind the name: ‘Hack’ refers to exploring and discovering layers deeper than surface-level and “Tao” stands for Yin and Yang. And both elements speak to their artistic dynamic.
   </p>
   <p>
    Hackatao was formed in 2007 and they use a variety of media to create artwork. In 2018, they began storing their work on the blockchain and quickly thrived in the cryptocurrency artspace as a result of how active and involved they are in the blockchain-based art scene.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    The Work of Hackatao
   </h3>
   <p>
    Hackatao’s artistic journey started with the creation of their Podmorks, little ceramic totem-shaped creatures decorated with drawings. Like the subsequent NFT work of Hackatoa, their Podmorks were a collage of interwoven pattern and colour. In 2018, they embraced the world of crypto art and their first NFT,

     Mad Dog’s graphic style is deeply inspired by cyberpunk and Japanese animation
