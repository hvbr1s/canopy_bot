     Crypto Tax. No, it’s not the title of the latest horror film – and you can’t switch it off either. But you CAN get it done simply and easily with ZenLedger
    </em>
    . O
    <em>
     ur newest partner specializes in helping you report crypto taxes. Let’s see how it works!
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    There’s no way around it – crypto is a taxable asset. This means reporting your crypto portfolio and trading activity is essential if you’re looking to stay compliant with
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto-regulation-how-to-stay-informed" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     regulation around crypto
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    But it’s a tricky old business.
   </p>
   <p>
    Crypto transactions are a different beast from their fiat counterparts. There’s no easy way to store your transaction receipts. No obvious records to submit to your accountant. With exchanges based all over the planet, it’s not always easy to understand if or when you’re transacting internationally and what that means.
   </p>
   <p>
    To top it off, trying to keep track of your gains and losses is a complicated process in an environment where prices are changing constantly.
   </p>
   <p>
    With so much to deal with, how on earth do you tackle your crypto taxes? Stay locked in – Ledger’s latest partnership has got you covered! Here’s your guide to managing crypto tax. First things first…
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Is my cryptocurrency really taxable?
   </h2>
   <p>
    The short answer: Yes.
   </p>
   <p>
    As with most other assets, you’ll be liable to pay fiat taxes based on financial gains you made on buying, selling or HODling crypto. And while no authority can tax your crypto while it’s still crypto. The gains you’ve made over time
    <em>
     can
    </em>
    be assessed and taxed once you’ve off-ramped into fiat. But exactly
    <em>
     how
    </em>
    it’s treated is the big question: this is where your crypto tax return comes in.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    But isn’t my crypto secret?
   </h3>
   <p>
    We hear you. The beauty of cryptocurrency is that it’s pseudonymous – blockchain contains no names and no personal details.
   </p>
   <p>
    But that doesn’t mean nobody knows you have crypto. More or less every crypto on-ramp, from crypto exchanges to API services, entails some sort of
    <em>
     Know-Your-Customer
    </em>
    procedure. Requiring you to identify yourself using photo ID, which is then linked with the platform wallet. The exchange or platform is then expected to share this data – and information about any suspicious activity on their platform – with central authorities.
   </p>
   <p>
    So while your activity on the blockchain might not bear your name, KYC procedures ensure that your entry into crypto is on record, while the blockchain itself keeps a ledger of every transaction you’re making there.
   </p>
   <p>
    This means the IRS has a means of knowing whether you’re transacting, earning, and trading your crypto from the point of entry onwards. In short – a tax return is non-negotiable.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    How do I do my crypto tax? My accountant doesn’t handle that
   </h3>
   <p>
    We know that might be intimidating. “
    <em>
     What the heck is a taxable event for crypto?
    </em>
    ” “
    <em>
     What records or statements?
    </em>
    ” “
    <em>
     How do I even report crypto tax?

    ZenLedger – Crypto Taxes Made Easy
   </h2>
   <p>
    <a href="https://www.zenledger.io/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     ZenLedger
    </a>
    is the leading crypto tax calculation software for the US system, with clients such as DeLoitte already on their books. And as a key Ledger, now you can access this cutting-edge tool easily from within your familiar Ledger Live interface.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    How does ZenLedger work?
   </h2>
   <p>
    No matter what you use crypto for or how often you transact, chances are you’ll have activity scattered across multiple exchanges, wallets, blockchains, assets and services. Confusing right?
   </p>
   <p>
    This is where ZenLedger comes in. Its easy-to-use interface makes it simple for you to assemble and process information about all of your crypto activity in one place. How does it do this?
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Aggregating Transactions
   </h3>
   <p>
    Say you’ve transacted across different exchanges using their native wallet, as well as from your Ledger hardware wallet, and also have a crypto balance in each one. The “imports” tab in Zen Ledger enables you to extract and aggregate transactions from multiple exchanges into one calculation. Simply choose the platform you’re importing from the drop-down menu. Meanwhile, you can use the wallet import tab to have your hardware wallet activity included in your tax calculation.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Identify Taxable Activity
   </h3>
   <p>
    OK so now you have all your transactions in one place, the scary part starts – how do you figure out which ones incurred tax liability? ZenLedger’s crypto-specific software analyses every transaction, and identifies pertinent tax events according to the US regime.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Track Coin Price Changes Over Time
   </h3>
   <p>
    One of the trickiest issues you’ll face when dealing with crypto is staying on top of the notorious price fluctuations, which of course impact your final tax calculation. Here, ZenLedger’s algorithm automatically takes into account price changes of all coins and tokens over time. Saving you the time and stress of meticulously tracking this yourself.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Insights and Tax Loss Harvesting
   </h3>
   <p>
    ZenLedger may be a tax tool, but it’s useful for a few other things too. With your crypto transaction data aggregated in one place, you can use the ZenLedger interface to review your activities, segment in various ways for insights. It even identifies opportunities to make your activity more tax efficient across the long-term. Maybe you’re looking to free up some cash to buy more of a certain coin. ZenLedger will identify areas within your portfolio where your tax can be optimized to achieve this.
   </p>
   <p>
    It’s not just for tax season – the tool is useful for anyone looking to trade efficiently.
