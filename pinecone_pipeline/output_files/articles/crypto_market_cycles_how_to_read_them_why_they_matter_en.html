    Money markets are exciting, unpredictable, and seemingly mysterious places. But, contrary to popular belief, there is some method to the madness.
   </p>
   <p>
    Checking the market each day might not yield much wisdom – but observing the patterns over time certainly will. We’re talking about market cycles.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Markets are Only Human
   </h3>
   <p>
    Trends and patterns of behavior occur in all financial markets, from stocks and shares to commodities, and more. No matter what type of marketplace we are dealing with, similar drivers will be in play; supply, demand, news events, and human emotions.
   </p>
   <p>
    The crypto market is no different.
   </p>
   <p>
    While market movements may seem random and unpredictable, over time, they tend to follow a fairly predictable pattern. Understanding that pattern enables one to make smarter and more informed decisions — even in the most tumultuous times.
   </p>
   <p>
    In this article, Ledger Academy aims to demystify these market cycles, so you can handle your crypto better.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Crypto Market Cycles Phase 1: The Accumulation Phase
   </h2>
   <p>
    There are four key phases to a market cycle, and technically it is possible to consider any of them could as the starting point. But for the sake of this article, let’s begin with the accumulation phase.
   </p>
   <p>
    Two things define each stage in any cycle: the activity of the market itself, and the sentiment driving that behaviour. So let’s look at each “phase” through the spectrum of these two things.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Accumulation Phase Sentiment: The Worst is Behind Us
   </h3>
   <p>
    Another title for the accumulation phase might be “the worst is behind us”. Normally it follows a significant market crash, and is generally the moment when the market starts turning. This is when a key group of big traders are confident that prices have hit their absolute bottom, and can only get better.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Characteristics of the Accumulation Page
   </h3>
   <p>
    Trading activity during the accumulation phase is moderate. Prices may even be subtly increasing in line with the first green shoots of confidence in the market.
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <strong>
      Big Traders Accumulate
     </strong>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    An interesting phenomenon occurs during accumulation. The market splits into two camps:  the glass-half-full buyers, and the glass-half-empty sellers.
   </p>
   <p>
    Many long-term HODLers, feeling they’ve lost faith in the market, are looking to sell their positions – and probably offering a low price on their assets to match.
   </p>
   <p>
    Meanwhile, market pioneers and whales with a vision (those who see the slump as just one phase of the game) take advantage of these low prices and start buying, confident the market will soon recover. The consequence of this is a huge transfer of assets. With a significant portion of the market ending up in the hands of just a few first movers – hence the name “accumulation”.
   </p>
   <p>
    So, the accumulation phase is marked by a recent crash, negative but gradually changing sentiment, and moderate trading volume. The market value overall stays the same. But a small group of big traders accumulates much of the asset.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Crypto Market Cycles Phase 2: The Markup Phase
   </h2>
   <p>
    After the accumulation phase comes the markup phase in regular market life cycles.
   </p>
   <p>
    In this phase, price action moves into a long-term, consistent up trend. Sentiment becomes decidedly positive. Therefore, interest in the market (and therefore its overall value, since people are willing to pay more) grows.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Sentiment: Greed Trumps Caution
   </h3>
   <p>
    Not surprisingly, this is also called the bull market period. If you were to measure this phase on the Bitcoin Greed and Fear index, you’d see a score nearing 100. Reflecting significant market
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/bitcoin/bitcoin-fear-and-greed-index-explained" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     greed
    </a>
    for the asset in question, and low levels of caution.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Heated Market, Rising Prices
   </h3>
   <p>
    Positive market sentiment peaks during this time; the majority of traders are optimistic about the future and are, therefore, more likely to take risks. When we talk about
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/glossary/what-is-fomo-in-crypto" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     FOMO
    </a>
    , this phase is generally when it happens. The excitement means buyers are willing to pay higher than normal prices for assets.
   </p>
   <p>
    Consequently, prices frequently hit new all-time highs (ATHs) during this phase.
   </p>
   <p>
    So where does the excitement end?  The answer lies with the whales. Just as the broader market is getting pumped up, big holders looking to sell for maximum profit start to dump. This is when the market takes a turn.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Crypto Market Cycles Phase 3: The Distribution Phase
   </h2>
   <p>
    The distribution phase marks the end of a bull run in the market, and it can be characterized by a “best is behind us” attitude. This is especially significant among the first movers, whose selling activities help to catalyze a shift throughout the market.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Sentiment: Mixed, and Declining Overall
   </h3>
   <p>
    This moment is when the first signs of doubt creep into a heated market, with sentiment becoming inconsistent between different groups.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some participants, believing the current surge to have peaked, may start liquidating their positions in preparation for an upcoming bear market. This is due to
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/the-ultimate-nft-glossary#:~:text=What%20are%20NFTs%3F,a%20gaming%20character's%20vector%20file.">
     fear of missing out
    </a>
    on potential profits.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, simultaneously, there are more optimistic market participants who believe that the bull market (and overall price uptick) is still in full swing, and are looking to keep buying, or at least HODL.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Trading Activity: Stable
   </h3>
   <p>
    This creates tension between the bulls and bears: price fluctuations will occur, but within a fairly constant range, since sentiment is split across fear and greed in different groups.
   </p>
   <p>
    As the stage advances – if it is truly a distribution phase and not another accumulation – sentiment will become more negative. Unfavorable news reports, coupled with ambiguity among traders, might eventually be enough to impact prices and cause a sell-off. At a minimum, fear increases over time, as doubt starts to creep in that the bull market might be over, and people make contingency plans.

    Crypto Market Cycles Phase 4: The Markdown Phase
   </h2>
   <p>
    The Markdown Phase is the final part of any market cycle. It can be seen as the bubble bursting on prior heated activity.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Sentiment: Fear Over Greed
   </h3>
   <p>
    In terms of sentiment, this phase is typically characterized by high levels of fear and low levels of greed. Leading to a lack of buying interest or new capital entering the market.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Steady Decline in Prices
   </h3>
   <p>
    As doubt and caution start to prevail across the market, large swathes of traders begin to sell their holdings to mitigate their exposure. The sell-off can lead to a sharp decline in prices, hence the name Markdown Phase.
   </p>
   <p>
    This phase is not necessarily negative for everyone: it’s potentially good news for the short sellers. For example, because shorting the market means they can profit from its decline.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Markdown Phase will continue until the market as a whole decides the worst is over, and prices cannot decrease any further. At this point, prices stabilize in the long-term, optimistic new buyers (and yes, those well-informed whales) step in to accumulate assets all over again, at favourable prices.
   </p>
   <p>
    You might recognize this transition – it’s the beginning of the Accumulation Phase we described at the very beginning – when the whole life cycle starts again.
