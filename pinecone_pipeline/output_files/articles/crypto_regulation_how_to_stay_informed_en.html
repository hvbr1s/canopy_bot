     Cryptocurrency, where tech meets finance – and both of them meet your future. The real question is – why would you
     <strong>
      not
     </strong>
     follow crypto regulation? Let’s get into it
    </em>
    !
   </p>
   <p>
    Few people took crypto seriously when Bitcoin’s white paper was first released in 2008. Despite its utility, popularity and sheer innovation, cryptocurrency struggled to gain legtitimacy for many years. Which is precisely why it’s so interesting that it’s now one of the most hotly debated regulatory issues for governments across the planet.
   </p>
   <p>
    Love it or hate it, the crypto industry isn’t going anywhere. And as it gains legitimacy, it becomes more of a focus for policymakers as they discuss where – and how – to exert control on the growing space.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Crypto Regulation is Hard to Follow
   </h2>
   <p>
    Regulation across the world is taking shape in different ways, and it can be hard to keep track of. Unlike politics or regular finance, staying up to date is not necessarily as simple as checking your regular news source, despite its significance.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    …Which Limits Your Ability to Have a Say
   </h3>
   <p>
    This has another effect too: it makes it difficult to know how you can have your voice heard when it comes to the future of decentralized finance (crypto IS meant to be democratic, after all).
   </p>
   <p>
    So to make Keeping Up With The Cryptocurrencies a little easier – and even enter the dialogue yourself – here is just what you need. Your guide to key sources of information about crypto regulation. Ready to have a say in your future?! HWG.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Crypto News Outlets
   </h2>
   <p>
    Staying informed is important. Especially if you own crypto yourself and want to know how you can use it going forward. Normally, for financial-related policy news you’d look to your regional media outlets, right? But crypto is still pretty niche. So the reporting is often not given enough prominence (relative to how significant certain events are) or otherwise lacks depth, detail and context.
   </p>
   <p>
    So crypto-literate news resources are crucial in tracking big developments and how they affect you. The following are some pretty great places to get to know what’s happening across the world.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    CoinDesk and Cointelegraph
   </h3>
   <p>
    Outlets such as
    <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     CoinDesk
    </a>
    and
    <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     Cointelegraph
    </a>
    are digital news platforms focused exclusively on news events involving the blockchain and Web3 space.
   </p>
   <p>
    As well as following big events and stories, they each have a dedicated policy section reporting on regulatory developments in the crypto industry. The information is objective and provides detailed coverage and insight into the global evolution of crypto regulation – as well as the events driving that evolution.
   </p>
   <p>
    These outlets are a great starting point for anyone looking to get their finger on the pulse of crypto regulation and gain a broad overview.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Blockworks
   </h3>
   <p>
    Relative newcomer
    <a href="https://blockworks.co/category/regulation/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     Blockworks
    </a>
    hit the scene just four years ago with the aim of being “Bloomberg for crypto”. Launched by Jason Yanowitz and Michael Ippolito, the digital media platform sits at the intersection between crypto and finance. Necessarily tracking all relevant policy activity around the industry. Here, you’ll find information that empowers you to understand the scene and imminent decisions.

   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Elliptic Blog
   </h3>
   <p>
    Elliptic is a crypto compliance consultancy firm that also regularly publishes crypto regulation news on its blog. With insights produced by its Global Policy and Research Group, the publication is a reliable source of insight on the evolving space, with expert opinions and quality research fueling its articles.

    Discussion and Debate
   </h2>
   <p>
    Crypto regulation is a point of intense debate; and not just policymakers themselves, but key industry voices, business experts and academics. All of whom bring valuable perspectives to the wider dialogue – and sometimes, influence the process.
   </p>
   <p>
    Podcasts are ideal platforms for listening to discussions, debates and deliberations between field experts. They can give you a little insight and context into what’s happening. This also empowers you to enter the dialogue yourself. Here are a few platforms where you can listen in:
