     If you’re reading this, you already know that crypto is a hot property. Whether your thing is coins, tokens or NFTs, we all have a vested interest in keeping our assets safe. “I know!” you say. Never give my private keys or share my recovery phrase with anyone. Well, that’s true, but it’s not the end of the story.

     <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-defi">

     </a>
     and dApps within the crypto scene, smart contracts are becoming more impressive.  If that’s news to you, make sure you check out the Ledger Academy article on what a smart contract is. But for this article, it’s important to understand that smart contracts are essential for executing complex processes in a decentralized manner. To do so, this computer program on the blockchain can store information and self-execute under the right conditions. However, to set off these conditions, a user just like you must sign a

     </a>
     .  Wait though, you are not a robot. So how does a person go about reading a blockchain transaction?
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    Well, it’s a difficult topic, and scammers
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
     are always on the lookout for new vulnerabilities in the transaction process. There are countless scams and
    </span>
    they can also be hard to detect
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
     , even for a crypto pro.

   </p>
   <h2>
    What is Blind Signing?
   </h2>
   <p>
    Simply, a blind signature is a type of wallet signature that allows users to approve a smart contract to interact with their wallet, without knowing the contract’s full details.
   </p>
   <h3>
    How Signing Contracts Translates on The Blockchain
   </h3>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
     To explain how this concept works digitally, let’s start with the pen-and-paper basics of the real world. Contracts exist to govern our relationships; whether it’s an employment contract requiring you to work 40 hours per week or a monthly Netflix subscription. When you sign a contract,
    </span>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
     you indicate that you understand and consent to its conditions.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-a-smart-contract" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
     <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      Smart contracts
     </span>
    </a>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
     – the infrastructure that powers dApps,
     <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-are-nft">
      NFTs
     </a>
     , and many elements of DeFi – work similarly. Let’s say you borrow some crypto from a lender, on the basis that each month you will pay back a set amount with interest. The lending protocol relies on smart contracts to function.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
     When you sign the smart contract using the private key corresponding to your hardware wallet, you’re essentially agreeing to its terms.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      But what if you can’t see the contract?
     </span>
    </i>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    </span>
   </p>
   <h3>
    Reading Smart Contracts As A Human Is Harder Than It Sounds
   </h3>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
     The smart contracts used in present-day dApps and NFTs have posed a challenge for the current generation of crypto wallets because their code – containing key contact details – cannot be fully extracted and displayed in a language that the user would understand. In other words, wallets are still playing catch-up with the latest options for consumers.
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    What Are The Dangers of Blind Signing
   </h2>
   <p>
    So now we know what blind signing is and some of the problems there are with reading signatures. Let’s get into some of the issues blind signing causes.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Blind Signing Allows For Specific Scams and Possible Fraud
   </h3>
   <p>
    With crypto bursting into the mainstream, more and more people are becoming educated about how to keep their assets secure, and there are fewer opportunities for scammers to gain access to your assets. So instead of trying to break the door open – they are relying on you to open it for them.
   </p>
   <p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
   </p>
   <p>
    This type of scam was popular with NFT drops. Bad actors would play on that excitement that came with the industry’s popularity and instead of minting, users would approve transactions that gave scammers access to their assets. So before you give a blind signature for an NFT drop, think. If it’s not a well-known brand, can you be sure the transaction you’re verifying is what you think it is?
   </p>
   <p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
   </p>
   <p>
    Private messages are another hotbed for this type of threat. For example, scammers posed as OpenSea tech admins on Discord, managing o scam an experienced collector. The scammer convinced his victim he was a service advisor and asked him to approve a transaction using his Ledger device. This showed no contract details and the victim believed it was safe. In reality, the transaction he was verifying provided access to his vault, and the advisor was a fraud. Unfortunately, the entire scenario was the staging for a scam.

    This is a perfect example of how even an experienced crypto user can make a mistake when the circumstances are convincing enough.

   <h3>
    Using Your Laptop or Phone To Transact Is Also Blind Signing
   </h3>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
     Whenever you sign any transaction using your computer screen, you are technically blind signing.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
     Let’s say you’re using a software wallet to complete a transaction. Since your display screen (the computer or mobile) is connected to the internet, it is
    </span>
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/hack-keylogging" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
     <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      vulnerable to hacking.
     </span>
    </a>
    As a result, t
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
     he screen of your laptop or phone can never be fully trusted; a hacker may have changed the details on-screen, leading you to sign a malicious transaction. In this case, you would still be “blind signing” becuase you are approving the transaction based on trust.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
     The point of using a
     <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto-hardware-wallet" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
      hardware wallet
     </a>
     such as a Ledger device is to eliminate this risk. Your wallet serves as a secure, offline venue that is impenetrable to hackers. As a result, its Trusted Screen will always show the true details of your smart contract transaction.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
     The “Trusted Display” on all Ledger devices is invaluable in making sure you know exactly what you’re agreeing to.
    </span>
   </p>
   <h2>
    Blind Signing is Sometimes Necessary
   </h2>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
     However, although your Ledger device will always display accurate transaction details, this is only possible
    </span>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      when those details are available.
     </span>
    </i>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
     And this is not always the case.
    </span>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
     Let’s say you’ve got the right security measures in place and that you’re making a swap using a combination of your Ledger device along with the soft wallet that’s connecting you to the dApp – good job!
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
     But, as we previously mentioned most software wallets i.e the middleware between your device and the dApp are
    </span>
    <i>
     <span style="font-weight: 400;">
      unable to read and fully extract the smart contract elements of the transaction
     </span>
    </i>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
     . This means that, even if you use your Ledger device to verify and complete the transaction, the device will be unable to show you full details –  since the middleware itself has nothing to transmit to it.
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
     Instead, the device will simply show “Data Present”, leaving you unable to view key details such as action, price, receiving address etc before confirming. Here’s how that looks:
    </span>

   <p>
    With no detail of what this contract entails, the only option here is to once again verify your transaction based on trust. This is why it’s called
    <em>
     blind signing.
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
   </p>
   <p>
    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
   </p>
   <p>
    Described in this way, blind signing seems pretty risky, but most of us are guilty of doing it; when was the last time you read the user agreement for that new service you signed up to? The fact is that we base many of our decisions on the reputation of who we are transacting with.

    Scams involving blind signing usually include a degree of social engineering. To explain, scammers specialize in meticulously creating an environment where you trust them enough to let your guard down.

    This type of scam is becoming all the more common because the sheer pace of evolution has made blind signing an industry norm. It’s time for the tools to catch up.

    At Ledger, our mission is to bring absolute transparency and security to every one of your transactions – that means being able to read your contract data each time you sign. Our latest upgrade achieves that by providing clear signing for every integrated dApp. This eliminates the vulnerability faced by users to bring the most secure and fluid experience possible.

   <p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
   </p>
   <p>
    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

   <p>
    Our upgrade sees two big improvements that make this possible. Not only can your Ledger device now read and display smart contract information for a range of dApps; the recent launch of our App Catalogue within Ledger Live enables you to access several DeFi and dApps from within the security of your Ledger device, so you can use Ledger’s ecosystem as a secure gateway to the dApps and services you love.

    Ledger Live is an open-source and open platform. This means if you’re a developer seeking to bring clear signing to your app, you can build a plug-in to make it Ledger Live compatible.,and allow your users to clear sign.

    If you’re not a developer, and the app you’re using isn’t integrated, you’ll still need an intermediary wallet such as Metamask for some of your transactions, and you won’t be able to clear sign using the Trusted Screen of your Ledger device.
