    While a web2 metaverse may have an in-game currency and allow you to buy items. These items are stuck in that game, impossible to use for anything else.

     Blockchain metaverses
    </a>
    allow you true ownership of your digital assets. One of the most popular blockchain metaverses today is Decentraland.
   </p>
   <p>
    This immersive 3d virtual world allows users to buy virtual plots of land using the Decentraland MANA cryptocurrency and provides a range of opportunities for adventure and creativity. With its decentralized governance system managed through the Decentraland DAO, the platform is entirely owned by users, ensuring a fair and secure experience for all.
   </p>
   <p>
    In this guide, we’ll dive into the exciting virtual world and explore all that this decentralized metaverse has to offer, starting with the basics.
    <br/>
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    What Is The Decentraland Metaverse?
   </h2>
   <p>
    Essentially, the Decentraland Metaverse is an immersive 3D virtual world that you can explore through your web browser. It allows you to create and sell customized clothes and accessories for your virtual avatar. It also allows you to own virtual plots of land on which to build experiences. Each piece of land, item, and avatar in this blockchain metaverse is an NFT, meaning it’s unique and impossible to replicate. This gives creators a chance to play, create and monetize their creations.
   </p>
   <p>
    But Decentraland is not just any metaverse platform. It operates in a decentralized manner, ensuring a fair and secure user experience. To explain, it’s not a central entity that chooses what happens to Decentraland. Instead, it uses a
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-a-dao" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    What Is the History of Decentraland?
   </h2>
   <p>
    Argentine blockchain experts Ari Meilich and Esteban Ordano created Decentraland in 2017. This started as a proof of concept that assigns ownership of digital real estate to users on the blockchain. They created the game’s smart contracts and originally conceived it as a 2D project. But over time, it evolved into a 3D virtual world.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    How Does the Decentraland Metaverse Work?
   </h2>
   <p>
    Decentraland Metaverse is a blockchain-based virtual world where users can buy, sell, and build on land they own using the platform’s native token, MANA. It operates on a decentralized infrastructure, allowing users to create and control their own experiences without a centralized authority.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    A 3-Layered Protocol
   </h3>
   <p>
    Decentraland has three layers in its protocol:
   </p>
   <p>
    The first layer called the consensus layer, is responsible for keeping track of each piece of virtual land including its owner and its contents. This is thanks to smart contracts, which are self-executing computer programs on the blockchain.
   </p>
   <p>
    The LAND content layer distributes content throughout the Decentraland Metaverse using a decentralized system that relies on many users. This way, no one person or group has too much control, which makes it more secure and fair.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then the third layer real-time layer enables peer-to-peer connections, meaning it allows users to interact with each other in real-time.
   </p>
   <p>
    Ultimately, these layers work together to create a decentralized virtual world where users can buy and sell virtual land, create and share content, and interact with each other.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Governance: About DCL DAO
   </h3>
   <p>
    So who manages Decentraland? The answer lies with the metaverse’s own Decentralized Autonomous Organization, or DAO. To explain, anyone that holds a MANA token can vote on proposals to improve Decentraland. Each holder can vote on changes such as issuing grants. This means Decentraland operates without a central authority, relying purely on its decentralized governance model instead.
   </p>
   <p>
    Each holder must vote using MANA, giving larger holders more voting power. One token is equal to one vote. Then LAND and Estate tokens grant holders 2000 votes.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Tokens in the Decentraland Ecosystem
   </h2>
   <p>
    Decentraland uses
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/passive-income-nfts">
     non-fungible tokens
    </a>
    (NFTs) to represent unique digital assets like virtual land. It also uses fungible tokens, like MANA cryptocurrency, as a means of exchange and governance in the Decentraland Metaverse.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    What is MANA?
   </h3>
   <p>
    MANA is the native cryptocurrency of the Decentraland Metaverse. To explain, MANA is an
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/glossary/what-are-erc-20-tokens" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     ERC-20 token
    </a>
    on the Ethereum blockchain. You can use MANA in-game to purchase virtual land, goods, and services within Decentraland. However, it’s not just an in-game currency, it’s also a
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-a-governance-token-and-why-does-it-matter" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     governance token
    </a>
    . To explain, it allows holders to participate in the decision-making process through the Decentraland DAO.
   </p>
   <p>
    As of today, the value of MANA is subject to the usual market fluctuations. You can buy, sell, or trade MANA on trading platforms. To buy MANA securely with Ledger, start by installing the Ledger Live application and select the Ethereum app on your Ledger device. Then click on the “Buy” button on the Ethereum page and choose a MANA exchange that is compatible with Ledger. You can then transfer it to your Ledger wallet by sending it to your Ethereum address.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    What Is LAND?
   </h3>
   <p>
    LAND is a virtual plot in the Decentraland metaverse, with each one represented by a unique NFT. In total, there are 90,601 plots of LAND. If you own
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/how-to-buy-land-in-the-metaverse-2">
     virtual land
    </a>
    , you have full control over it, including the ability to develop, monetize and govern it. Then, the cost of different lands varies depending on their location and size, with some selling for millions of dollars.
   </p>
   <p>
    You can use a Ledger hardware wallet to secure your Decentraland land and other NFTs. First, connect your Ledger device to your device and unlock it. Then, install an Ethereum wallet on your device if you haven’t already via the Ledger Live application. From there, you can transfer your LAND to your secure Ledger wallet.
   </p>
