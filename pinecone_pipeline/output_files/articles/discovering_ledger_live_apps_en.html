    So, you may be familiar with
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-a-dapp" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     what Decentralized Apps (dApps) are
    </a>
    , but how confident are you in using them? It’s no secret that interacting with the blockchain can be complex, time-consuming, and downright confusing. As a result, crypto users find themselves at risk of signing malicious transactions or sharing sensitive information with bad actors. Simply, the technical nature of tools can make it almost impossible to navigate the crypto market.
   </p>
   <p>
    So how do you get involved with the blockchain’s many benefits while staying safe and in control of your assets?
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Ledger Live: Making Web3 Apps Easy
   </h2>
   <p>
    Well,
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     Ledger Live
    </a>
    is a single app that exists to facilitate your interactions with the blockchain. Through its discover feature, it gives you access to multiple web3 apps in one place. You don’t have to worry about accessing each one separately, nor do you have to switch between them. Ledger Live’s discover feature is your key to functionality in the web3 ecosystem.
   </p>
   <p>
    While it was once a difficult task, Ledger Live also facilitates the connection between web3 apps and your hardware wallet. This helps you ensure that your transactions are secure and encrypted so no malicious third parties can gain access to them. Furthermore, it removes the dangers of blind signing by providing you with human-readable transactions.
   </p>
   <p>
    Lastly, and possibly most importantly, this offers you the opportunity to interact with web3 apps securely and with full ownership over your assets. Put simply, it’s a one-stop shop designed to make your crypto life much easier.
   </p>
   <p>
    So, what kind of apps are on offer and how does Ledger Live help you use them? Let’s explore:
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    What are Ledger Live Apps?
   </h2>
   <p>
    Ledger Live Apps are blockchain apps you can access directly through the ‘Discover’ feature. These third-party applications let you extend the features of your Ledger device and your web3 experience, giving you more ways to use it.
   </p>
   <p>
    So, how does it all work?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Put simply, Ledger Live has an easy-to-use interface that provides you with easy access to apps and decentralized apps (dApps).
   </p>
   <p>
    To access them, you just need to click the “discover” tab in your Ledger Live app. This is your connection to apps and dApps from Ledger Partners. However, it’s important to keep in mind that Ledger does not operate the apps in the Live Apps Catalog. Rather, it acts as a
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/blog/becoming-your-safe-gateway-to-all-your-crypto-services-with-ledger-apps-catalog" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     gateway
    </a>
    to facilitate the connection between you and these services.
   </p>
   <p>
    But before you start exploring, let’s look at the types of Live Apps there are to choose from and why you might want to use them.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    A Live App for Every Occasion
   </h2>
   <p>
    Ledger Live is much more than a traditional cryptocurrency wallet, it gives you access to a whole world of different applications. Whether you want to keep track of your money, stake some crypto, own NFTs, chat with others, or play games – there’s an app or dApp for every occasion.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Apps For NFTs
   </h2>
   <p>
    There are several NFT-related Live Apps. To explain,
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-are-nft" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     Non-fungible tokens
    </a>
    (NFTs) represent unique or rare digital and real-world assets. Unlike other crypto assets or fiat currencies, NFTs cannot be divided into smaller parts. They are indivisible representations of information and value. The following apps offer ways to manage, store, or visualize NFTs.

    Another popular type of web3 app includes staking apps.

Through staking, you are contributing to the blockchain’s defense against malicious attacks and helping make it easier for transactions to be processed. This is an increasingly attractive option for cryptocurrency owners who seek additional rewards in a secure environment.
