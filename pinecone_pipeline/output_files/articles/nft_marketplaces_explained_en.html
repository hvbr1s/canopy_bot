    <em>
     You’ve heard the buzz, but you might be wondering where to buy NFTs. Here, we give you the ultimate guide for every blockchain.
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are digital assets that use blockchain technology to and can prove ownership. Just like the blockchain they are deployed on, NFTs are immutable and completely traceable.  Accordingly, you can use NFTs to
    <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://ethereum.org/en/nft/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     prove ownership
    </a>
    of just about anything digital or physical. NFTs allow us to digitize anything; from a piece of digital art to a digital representation of a physical deed to a house.
   </p>
   <p>
    As a result, there are now countless platforms aiming to support each type of non-fungible token. But which platforms are best for finding NFTs to buy? And how do they even work?
   </p>
   <p>
    You might know where to buy Bitcoin, but buying NFTs is a little different. Just like there are countless types of NFTs, there are an overwhelming number of platforms supporting them. Each platform has its advantages and disadvantages: Some focus on creators and others focus on traders. Then, some charge exorbitant fees and some don’t respect creator royalties. When deciding where to buy an NFT from, it’s important that the marketplace suits your needs.
   </p>
   <p>
    So where do we start? And what is an NFT marketplace anyway?
   </p>
   <p>
    Let’s dive in and explain exactly what you should know about NFT marketplaces so you can make an informed decision about where to buy your next NFT.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    What Is An NFT Marketplace?
   </h2>
   <p>
    On a base level, an NFT Marketplace is a platform that lets you buy and sell non-fungible tokens. Usually, they accept cryptocurrencies, but many also accept fiat payments through services like Moonpay. Most marketplaces only support one or two networks, meaning you will only be able to buy NFTs on that specific chain, be it Ethereum, Solana, or similar. However, only chains capable of deploying smart contracts have their own NFT marketplaces, as smart contracts are the backbone of NFTs.
   </p>
   <p>
    But how can you get in on the NFT action? That’s where NFT marketplaces come in.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    What Is an NFT Marketplace For?
   </h2>
   <p>
    NFT marketplaces let you buy, sell and visualize your digital assets. In fact, some of the top NFT marketplaces also let you create NFTs. This process can vary slightly for each marketplace, but their basic features allow for:
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Visualizing NFTs
   </h3>
   <p>
    They provide a platform where you can see your own NFT collections and check out other people’s through profiles on the platform (similar to social media, only without interaction).
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Buying NFTs
   </h3>
   <p>
    Markets allow you to browse NFTs and collections and have search functions for finding what you want. You can usually filter NFT by specific characteristics and price. Plus some marketplaces even show you an NFT’s rarity and rank. Buying NFTs usually requires cryptocurrencies. While some platforms offer the option to pay for blockchain assets with fiat currencies (such as Euros or Dollars), most only accept crypto.  Of course, this also requires a crypto wallet.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Selling NFTs
   </h3>
   <p>
    NFT marketplaces also let you sell NFTs. Anyone can sell an NFT, whether that’s the token’s creator or collector. Each marketplace differs, but they usually offer several selling options. For example, you could list an NFT for a set price. Or you could set up more complicated sales depending on the platform, such as timed auctions, dutch auctions, bulk listings, and more.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Which Marketplace Is Best: Where Do I Buy NFTs?
   </h2>
   <p>
    The best marketplace for you depends on what kind of features you’re looking for. If you’re a creator, you might want a marketplace to offer minting capabilities. If you’re a trader, you’ll likely want to find low platform fees. Buying and selling NFTs is easy once you know which features are best for you.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    On-ramp Services Are Great For Beginners
   </h3>
   <p>
    Some platforms facilitate the transition to web3 by offering on-ramp services. This means you can use your credit card to buy tokens directly through the NFT marketplace, instead of going to a crypto exchange.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    The Best Marketplaces For Creators Can Mint NFTs
   </h3>
   <p>
    Creating a new NFT is called minting, much like you would “mint” traditional currencies.  Only some marketplaces allow users to create a new NFT. But those that do let you upload whatever file you want to store or sell, such as a work of art or music.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some platforms, such as OpenSeam also offer
    <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://nftschool.dev/tutorial/lazy-minting/#how-it-works" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     lazy minting
    </a>
    . This only mints the NFT once a buyer wants to purchase it – and also charges the buyer instead of the seller. While it’s a risky move, as collectors rarely like paying increased fees, it reduces the barrier to entry for creators.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    The Best Marketplaces For NFT Traders Can Bypass Fees
   </h3>
   <p>
    Marketplaces provide a platform for sellers to market their NFTs in exchange for a small commission at the point of sale. They get access to clients, and the platform gets a cut. Fee structures can vary from platform to platform, with some NFT marketplaces charging sellers up to a 10% platform fee on each sale.  If you’re a big trader, this fee will eat into your profits.
   </p>
   <p>
    Royalties also differ across marketplaces, with some respecting creator royalties and some finding loopholes in which buyers can bypass these creator fees.
   </p>
   <p>
    So now you know how an NFT marketplace works and what it can do, let’s dive into how to choose where you should buy NFTs. Here are the top NFT marketplaces, and an explanation of their best features:
   </p>

   <p>
    Ethereum was the original network to make NFTs popular. All of the most popular NFT collections, such as the

    (ENS) NFTs. OpenSea is notable for being one of the very first NFT marketplaces, and today offers virtually any type of NFT imaginable, including audio files, digital media, and virtual worlds.  It’s great for beginners; it is free to join and browse and makes it easy to mint or buy NFTs with ease. They even accept over 150 payment methods. OpenSea also allows lazy minting, meaning you have the ability to list NFTs before minting them. This allows users to pay the gas fee only once the NFT has been sold.

    Nifty Gateway
   </h3>
   <p>
    Nifty Gateway is a centralized NFT platform, which comes with its own risk. The platform uses native hot wallets. This means any coins or tokens in this wallet aren’t truly yours, as the platform controls the corresponding private key. This is convenient since you don’t need to worry about managing your private keys, but it also means you don’t fully control your assets. This can be risky as if the platform closes down or runs into financial trouble, your assets could be at stake.
