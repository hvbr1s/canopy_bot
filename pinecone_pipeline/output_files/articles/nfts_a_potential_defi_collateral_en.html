     NFTs
    </a>
    have been exploding recently gaining massive popularity amongst digital artists, gamers, collectors and traders of digital assets. As tokens that can digitally represent anything (literally), NFTs have been revolutionizing how we see digital ownership. Hand-in-hand with decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs have incredible potential to become effective collateral. How? Well, let’s get into it!
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     Crash course 1: What is a NFT?
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    NFT stands for a non-fungible token. Basically, meaning one NFT is not changeable for another NFT and each unique token has its own value. (As opposed to a fungible token, like Bitcoin where one BTC equals another BTC).
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     Crash course 2: What is collateral?
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    Collateral refers to any asset that someone will offer as security to get a loan. It’s a pledge from the borrower to say that they’ll uphold paying back the loan. It is protection for the lender so that they won’t suffer major losses if the borrower can’t pay back the loan.
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     Okay, you’re ready. Let’s take a deep dive:
    </em>
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    The Nifty Nature of NFTs and How These Tokens Can Be Used as DeFi Collateral
   </h2>
   <p>
    Traditionally, a valuable asset can be used as collateral in return for a loan or for credit. Typically an asset like a car, house, or land is used as a pledge. We also see authentic art collections used as collateral. The key factor is that collateral requires something that has an esteemed value attached to it.
   </p>
   <p>
    And the digital realm holds the same notion: Collateral for a loan requires a valued asset to act as security. Thus, enter NFTs.
   </p>
   <p>
    NFTs have proven that they can be valued extremely highly (take this
    <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.christies.com/features/Monumental-collage-by-Beeple-is-first-purely-digital-artwork-NFT-to-come-to-auction-11510-7.aspx" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     digital collage that went for a whopping $69 million dollars
    </a>
    as a quick example) and many NFTs are collectable, varying in rarity and desirability. Because of the potential to hold value, NFTs make great collateral in the digital world. The owner of the NFT could put up the digital asset as collateral and take out a loan through smart contracts.
   </p>
   <p>
    This is beneficial for both: There is protection for the lenderd with the NFT as collateral. The borrower will have the opportunity to receive a loan without having to jump through the numerous hoops of the traditional financial system.
   </p>
   <p>
    Typically, the value prospect of an NFT is equal to or more than the loan. If the borrower can’t return the loan, the NFT will be liquidated so that the lender can be reimbursed for the loan. On paper, this sounds ideal, right? Right! But in practice, there are a few things that need resolving as the industry evolves.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Challenges NFTs Need to Overcome Before Being Used as DeFi Collateral
   </h2>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    1. Complex Copyright – Authenticating and Certifying NFTs
   </h3>
   <p>
    One of the big challenges is the authentication of NFTs. As unique tokenized assets, the major value of NFTs lies in the ownership – something that is represented on the blockchain. NFTs provide a verifiable history of transfer and ownership. The underlying artwork isn’t often part of this, so copyright becomes a little complicated.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    2. Assessing and Appraisals – Volatility and Value Strength
   </h3>
   <p>
    Volatility is a well-known obstacle in the world of cryptocurrency. While the NFT market can be treated differently from crypto, there is still underlying volatility with digital assets that makes appraisals and evaluations of the tokenized assets challenging. With digitally created assets, there’s the added layer of valuing something in an inherently subjective industry. It’s a challenge to value art physically and the digital realm is no different.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    3. Tricky Tokenizing – Physical Assets vs Digital Assets
   </h3>
   <p>
    Tokenizing physical assets opens up massive potential for individuals looking to liquidity. It becomes a little tricky and requires looking at regulation and legal compliance. In the same way that there’s a process – and usually expensive legal teams involved – when putting up your house or a car up as collateral, tokenizing physical assets requires a legal and regulatory framework.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    4. Safety and security – Setting Up Strong Storage
   </h3>
   <p>
    Blockchain is well known for its immutability and there’s incredible security within the technology. However, there are chinks in the armour when it comes to how individuals might choose to store their NFTs. In the same way that art can be stolen, there are

    </a>
    have hit the market with deceptive minters looking to make money off original NFTs. Combatting this particular challenge, though, isn’t difficult if you remember “

     not your key, not your NFT ”
    </em>
    and store and safeguard your NFT responsibly.
