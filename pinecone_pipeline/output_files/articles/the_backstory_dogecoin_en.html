    <em>
     The Dogecoin backstory is a fascinating one. Much irony. Such potential.
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    Not many people know about the wonderfully wacky history of Dogecoin. While it made its name as a bit of a meme in the crypto market, there’s a lot more to it than meets the eye. The internet’s love for Shiba Inu dogs shot Dogecoin into star status, but why are people so crazy about it?
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    What Is Dogecoin?
   </h2>
   <p>
    Well, in its simplest form is a Dogecoin cryptocurrency coin that can be
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/coin/wallet/dogecoin" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     exchanged and sent between wallets
    </a>
    . But in reality, it’s so much more than that.
   </p>
   <p>
    Dogecoin is a symbol; an apt representation of what the heart of the cryptocurrency industry can mean. But how on earth is a token that started life as a meme worth so much to so many people?
   </p>
   <p>
    Well, to understand that, let’s dig into Dogecoin’s backstory.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    The Backstory of Dogecoin
   </h2>
   <p>
    Dogecoin was created as a joke to poke fun at the cryptocurrency industry and the sudden interest the scene was receiving. Jackson Palmer, a sceptical Adobe product manager back in the day, created Dogecoin as a tongue-in-cheek dig at the hype of the burgeoning financial technology. His best way of satirising a cryptocurrency? Through a meme itself. Using “Doge”, the popular meme of the Shiba Inu dog, as literally the face of the cryptocurrency (yes, literally), Dogecoin at its essence is dripping in meme culture.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, the idea of a satirical token quickly led to a surprising amount of support and Palmer realised he had something on his hands. With that, he bought and launched the domain dogecoin.com. At the time, Billy Markus, an IBM software engineer, was trying to build and launch his cryptocurrency (Luckycoin) but was having no luck in marketing it (the irony isn’t lost on us either). So he got in touch with Palmer to ask if he could build the software.
   </p>
   <p>
    The two teamed up and officially launched Dogecoin into the wild at the end of 2013. Two weeks later, it saw a massive 300% jump in price. Maybe it was the ever-endearing face of the Shiba Inu on the token that enticed people. Maybe it was the fact that China had just banned banks from investing in cryptocurrency. (Okay, okay, it was
    <em>
     probably
    </em>
    the latter.)
   </p>
   <p>
    Either way, the coin shot up in price and gained popularity as a result of these
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/buy/dogecoin" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     Dogecoin token purchases
    </a>
    . Three days later, the value faced a massive plummet but intrigue had already been garnered and the token had a name for itself in the scene.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    How Does Dogecoin Work?
   </h2>
   <p>
    At first glance, Dogecoin might look like a joke form of
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/coin/price/bitcoin" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     Bitcoin
    </a>
    . However, if you pull back the curtain, you’ll see that there are different elements in the technology. At the heart of it, there are a couple of key differences which sets DOGE apart from the other cryptocurrencies.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    The Tech Behind The Token
   </h3>
   <p>
    Firstly, Dogecoin has an unlimited supply whereas others (like Bitcoin and Litecoin) have a hard cap on how many coins can ever exist. This plays an important role in the
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/coin/price/dogecoin" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     price of Dogecoin
    </a>
    . To illustrate, it’s much more affordable than Bitcoin, but it also runs the risk of devaluation.
   </p>
   <p>
    Dogecoin is very different from Bitcoin indeed. For starters, Dogecoin transactions are a lot faster and cheaper. However, the whole network is a lot less secure than its more traditional counterparts.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Dogecoin: Beyond The Cryptocurrency
   </h2>
   <p>
    From its satirical start, the Dogecoin community has set itself apart from others as a supportive group. Not only to the Doge but going beyond cryptocurrency to support causes across the world.
   </p>
   <p>
    In January 2014, just after its launch, the Doge community decided to fund
    <a aria-label=" (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/20/jamaican-bobsled-team-raises-dogecoin-winter-olympics" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     the Jamaican bobsled team’
    </a>
    s journey to the Sochi Winter Olympics. The 27 million DOGE (which counted for around $30,000 at the time) was donated without any incentive or promotion by the founders. In fact, Palmer was at a local pub and saw the value of the token rise. Even he wasn’t ready for what was to come.
   </p>
   <p>
    In March, the Dogecoin Foundation, a non-profit, gathered $11,000 worth of Dogecoin to
    <a aria-label=" (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://www.coindesk.com/dogecoin-foundation-raise-50k-kenya-water-crisis" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     fund and build a well in Kenya
    </a>
    . The campaign named #Doge4Water raised an incredible 16.3 million DOGE. And that community saw the DOGE community as much more than crypto-loving basement dwellers.
   </p>
   <p>
    And that’s the kicker: Dogecoin, at its root, is a cryptocurrency that represents more than money. It stands as a point that while
    <em>
     not
    </em>
    taking itself so seriously, it’s given a serious amount of room to influence the scene.
   </p>
   <p>
    It seems to have positioned itself as a symbol to break the status quo, to rebel against financial control.
   </p>
   <p>
    And its user base is all here for it.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Elon Musk’s love for the Doge
   </h2>
   <p>
    Elon Musk weighed in on the irony that Dogecoin has managed to yield such a firm following, saying on social media app Clubhouse that “
    <em>
     fate loves irony”
    </em>
    and that the
    <em>
     “most entertaining outcome and the most ironic outcome would be that dogecoin becomes the currency of Earth in the future
    </em>
    .”
   </p>
   <p>
