    <em>
     If you’re exploring blockchain apps and platforms in the wonderful world of web3, you’ve probably heard about Metamask.
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    Represented using the face of a fox, MetaMask is one of the most popular crypto wallets today, and certainly the most famous hot wallet so far. However, to use MetaMask securely, it’s good practice to use it in combination with a hardware wallet such as a Ledger device.
   </p>
   <p>
    But before we get there, let’s dive into the basics. In fact, what is MetaMask all about?
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-metamask">
    What Is MetaMask?
   </h2>
   <p>
    MetaMask is a non-custodial cross-chain software wallet. To explain what that means, let’s break that down.
   </p>
   <p>
    So firstly, MetaMask is non-custodial: it allows you to control and manage your own private keys.  Unlike a bank or a wallet on a crypto exchange, MetaMask does not have any power over the funds in your account. As long as you’re the only one with access to those private keys, you are the sole owner and manager of your account.
   </p>
   <p>
    Next, it’s cross-chain, as MetaMask allows you to manage accounts on multiple networks, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Polygon. Specifically, MetaMask supports EVM chains, and may even branch out to other networks in future.
   </p>
   <p>
    And finally, it’s a software wallet. This means it operates purely via software— via a plugin that you can install on Chrome, Brave, and Firefox internet browser. This means its interface is connected to the internet, which makes it very accessing blockchain applications (
    <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-a-dapp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways%3A,very%20much%20a%20developing%20technology.&amp;text=Regardless%20if%20it's%20a%20web,in%20roughly%20the%20same%20way." rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     dApps
    </a>
    ). But it also means that MetaMask stores your private keys within the software’s interface, plus, it signs transactions while connected to the internet. To understand how this works, let’s firstly dive into its purpose.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    What is MetaMask For?
   </h2>
   <p>
    Cryptocurrencies and blockchains have more use cases than you can possibly imagine, and to access all of them you’ll need a crypto wallet. More specifically, most decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols only support a few different wallets, and often, MetaMask will make that short list.
   </p>
   <p>
    This is simply because MetaMask was designed to work with these applications. Since you can use your MetaMask credentials to access these services with ease, it lowers the barrer to entry for new crypto users.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus, there are countless blockchain apps and platforms you can connect to with Metamask, with almost too many features and genres to name, but here are a few things you can do using MetaMask:

    MetaMask Crypto Wallets: What Are The Risks?
   </h2>
   <p>
    But as with any good thing, using MetaMask comes with some risks. Anything connected to the internet is not entirely secure, not even the government systems that suck in billions of dollars to maintain high levels of security. The same goes for MetaMask.
   </p>
   <p>
    Essentially, software wallets, including MetaMask, generate and protect your private keys on your host device, such as your smartphone or laptop. This same device is connected to the internet and thus leaves room for hackers to attack and steal users’ funds. If a hacker gains access to that internet connected device, they may be able to install malware to tamper with your screen, or even worse, manage to extract your private keys to immediately drain your funds.
   </p>
   <p>
    For example, a Reddit user explains
    <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Metamask/comments/nxud2t/warning_accounts_are_getting_hacked_use_caution/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     here
    </a>
    how a hacker hacked his system to transfer 1.98 ETH worth approximately 5,000 dollars at the time of writing to another wallet. The Redditor also added that a potential malware installed in their system changed any copied crypto wallet address to a different one upon pasting; this type of scam exploits

    to gain access to your funds – this is something all software wallet users should be aware of. Last year in April, the official MetaMask wallet of a crypto project called EasyFi got

    , losing over 75 million dollars worth of crypto assets.

    Why You’d Want To Use MetaMask with Ledger

    In general, using a

    is the most secure way to store the private keys.  That’s because they store your private keys and sign transactions offline. This guarantees that no one on the internet can access them. Connecting an account on your Ledger with a Metamask wallet allows you to protect your private keys, sign transactions offline, and still access all of the apps and platforms you want.

    How To Set Up Metamask To Connect To Ledger

    First, get yourself a

    to safeguard your private keys. Ledger devices come with a software called Ledger Live (available on mobile &amp; desktop), which is basically the equivalent of the app store to the iPhone, providing you with a safe gateway to all your crypto services and downloadable for free through this

     link
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    From there, you’ll also need to install Metamask. MetaMask is a browser extension compatible with Chrome, Firefox, Brave and Edge, so make sure you’re using a compatible internet browser before you get started. Plus, make sure to find the official Metamask website to download the wallet fake wallet sites are a potential scam you could encounter.
   </p>
   <p>
    Once you have those elements sorted, you’re ready to begin. Here’s a step by step guide on how to set it up:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     Open Ledger Live and Click on “Accounts” on the left hand side.
    </li>
    <li>
     Create your Ethereum account by clicking ‘add an Ethereum account’
    </li>
    <li>
     Open Metamask to set up a new wallet. Here you’ll then face an important question:
     <strong>
      create new wallet,
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      import existing wallet.
     </strong>
     Here, opt to
     <strong>
      create new wallet
     </strong>
     . We’ll explain why below.
    </li>
    <li>
     Approve the next page: this relates to sharing data with MetaMask
    </li>
    <li>
     Create a password when prompted on the page that follows: this will be your login credential for each time you want to use MetaMask going forward.
    </li>
    <li>
     On the next screen, you’ll receive the recovery phrase words for your MetaMask wallet. Once you’ve confirmed that you’ve seen and recorded this phrase, your MetaMask set-up is complete.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Which Recovery Phrase Do I use?
   </h3>
   <p>
    You might be wondering at this point what the difference is between the MetaMask recovery phrase and the one you received when you first set up your Ledger device.
   </p>
   <p>
    The answer is pretty simple – each phrase relates to a separate set of addresses on the blockchain. The difference is that the Ledger recovery phrase has never been exposed online, while the MetaMask phrase has. This is an important vulnerability that all software wallets suffer – your keys and seed phrase are all generated online within the interface, and as you know, this leaves them open to hacks and spyware deployed via your connection. This is why it is so essential to use a wallet that generates this data offline and keeps it there.
   </p>
   <p>
    In this process, we will be showing you how to use your Ledger device as your wallet, while leveraging MetaMask browser extension as an intermediary for interacting with Web3. This means that for you, the relevant words remain your Ledger recovery phrase. Make sure it’s stored safely, you know the drill!
