    Ledger hardware wallets are about security – but there are some risks even your Ledger can’t protect you from. In this section, let’s talk about common Web3 scams tactics, and what you need to be aware of as you explore the space.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Web3 Scams
   </h2>
   <p>
    In Web3, absolutely
    <em>
     anyone
    </em>
    can launch a project and start selling tokens – there is no business check, no regulator, and no code of conduct for crypto projects.
   </p>
   <p>
    More importantly, since blockchain transactions are immutable, there is no way of getting your crypto back if you do make a bad judgment call. Once it’s gone, it’s gone. That’s why it’s so important to be aware of the different scams in the Web3 space, and how to spot them before they spot you.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    What is Shilling?
   </h2>
   <p>
    Shilling is not a new scam – in fact, it’s as old as trading itself.
   </p>
   <p>
    When a product or business idea is being “shilled”, it means that an individual is advocating for the idea, not based on its merits, but for personal gain.
   </p>
   <p>
    They may tell you that the project is a “once in a lifetime opportunity!!” or that you “need to buy now before it sells out!”. Either way, the objective is to make you believe the idea is a great investment opportunity and to feel anxious about missing out.
   </p>
   <p>
    In reality, it’s not really a great opportunity at all – and the person who really stands to gain from your investment is the shill.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    What is Crypto Shilling?
   </h3>
   <p>
    In the free and easy world of crypto – where anyone can launch a project and seek your support – shilling is something you need to be able to spot.
   </p>
   <p>
    A little hype can go a long way. Even just a few new investors in a project means that the demand for its token will rise. And as the price increases in line with that demand, the overall value of the project balloons. So when you think about it, there is a pretty big incentive for someone to shill a project, especially if they are personally invested.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    How to Spot Crypto Shilling
   </h3>
   <p>
    Crypto shilling may not always be obvious. You might not always find someone saying “Hey! Look at this great token, you should 100% invest in it right now if you want to make money and save the world!.” Instead, it might look like this:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     The celebrity influencer
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Not all influencers are on Instagram. In the cryptocurrency scene, you might come across an influential figure, like a celebrity or high-profile business person, endorsing a project.
   </p>
   <p>
    But remember: they may be getting paid for that endorsement, or have shares in the project themselves. Either way, their advice is not impartial, and will not benefit you – it is driven by self-interest.
   </p>
   <p>
    The lesson? Always ask why. When an influential figure seems to suddenly turn their attention and advocacy to a cryptocurrency or crypto project – especially when they showed little interest in the market before – there’s a good chance they’re looking out for themselves, not you.
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     The project founder
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Naturally, the teams behind a cryptocurrency project want the project to succeed – they also likely have large shares in it themselves. So it stands to reason that they will hype it up to stimulate interest and ultimately, investment.
   </p>
   <p>
    But remember, as the team behind the project, and probably also investors, their advice is unlikely to be impartial.
   </p>
   <p>
    The lesson? Do your own research. If a team promises to deliver the world and more, cross-check it with their roadmap,
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/how-to-read-a-white-paper" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     white paper
    </a>
    and other sources such as
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/how-to-read-smart-contract-data" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">

    (we’ll come back to this).

    Rugpulls – The Perfect Scam for Crypto
   </h2>
   <p>
    Let’s talk now about a slightly different type of scam you’ll likely come across in the Web3 ecosystem.
   </p>
   <p>
    Rugpulls are exactly what they sound like: someone pulling the rug from under you. In the case of crypto, a rug pull involves a completely bogus project selling crypto or NFTs, with the promise of a bright future.
   </p>
   <p>
    Not wanting to miss this opportunity to buy in before the price rockets, hopeful buyers purchase some of the project’s assets. The kicker? There is no future in the project – and the creators know this even as they take your money.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    The Pump and Dump Cycle Explained
   </h3>
   <p>
    Once you and other investors have sunk your money into the project (pumped it with crypto), the demand and price of the tokens increase. Then, the creators or founders sell  (dump) their own shares – which are now inflated in price, thanks to the demand created by you and other victims.
   </p>
   <p>
    There is a subtle difference between plain, old crypto shilling and a fully-fledged rug pull. The project endorsed by a crypto shill may well be legitimate, it’s just that the shill’s own endorsement can never be truly impartial. Meanwhile, the defining feature of a rug pull is that
    <em>
     the creators of the project never had any intention of seeing it through
    </em>
    , and always intended to abandon it after selling their shares. The project behind a rug pull is worthless from the very outset – it’s a facade. At the end, you and other investors are always left with tokens of a project that no longer exists.
   </p>
   <p>
    A recent example of this is the alleged
    <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sushiswap-returns-14-million-exit-scam/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     SushiSwap (SUSHI) exit scam
    </a>
    . The project saw a significant price increase, and its creator, the anonymous Chef Nomi, instantly cashed out $14 million. This crashed the price of SUSHI from over $9 to just over a dollar in less than a week. After extreme community backlash, Chef Nomi eventually sent the funds back. Most rug pulls don’t end that positively.

    How to Avoid Getting Scammed: A Summary
   </h2>
   <p>
    The freedom of Web3 makes it a perfect environment for scams. Even if your keys are totally safe inside your Ledger device, it is still up to
    <em>
     you
    </em>
    to scrutinize projects before you buy in.

    Here are some basic tips to help you:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Ask yourself why a given person is reaching out to you – could they have an interest in the conversation?
    </li>
    <li>
     <span style="color: initial;">
      Never respond to private messages recommending crypto projects
     </span>
     – there is no reason for anyone to contact you privately in Web3.
    </li>
    <li>
     Do your own research (DYOR). Objective data is the only way to truly assess a project, so research will empower you to make an informed decision independently.
    </li>
   </ul>

   <p>
    Now you know some of the novel risks you’ll face as you explore Web3, it’s time to read up on how to conduct your own research. Crypto security means educating yourself about which questions to ask and where to look for answers. So let’s tackle that next.
