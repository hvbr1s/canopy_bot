    around, gaming or scoping out other singletons from our phone, a huge amount of our life now takes place online.
   </p>

     30 years since the internet first changed the world
    </a>
    and, as with any new technology, it’s been slowly morphing over time to incorporate new possibilities. But some changes are so profound that they transform the whole story, and right now one of those transformations is unfolding. Are you prepared for Web 3.0?
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Wait – there’s more than one internet?!
   </h2>
   <p>
    Let’s say there’s more than one
    <em>
     chapter
    </em>
    of the internet: the first was anchored by freedom of information, and the second by freedom of expression. We’ll come back to that. What’s important is that the implications of each new chapter have been huge.
   </p>
   <p>
    <a aria-label="The first generation of the web (opens in a new tab)" href="https://youtu.be/jv0y31n_ndE" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     The first generation of the web
    </a>
    wasn’t actually called Web 1.0; we gave it that label retrospectively, as new versions came to pass. At its genesis in the 90’s, the internet was sometimes called the “Information Web” and that’s a pretty accurate description – it was developed to allow research to be shared among academics and governments, and it basically functioned as a library.
   </p>
   <p>
    Content was created by a tiny hierarchy of publishers and webpages did not support changes, meaning no comment sections, communities or personal content. Although Web 1.0 didn’t allow us to collaborate or edit web content, it
    <em>
     did
    </em>
    somewhat democratise communication and access to information.  Now anyone with an internet connection could not only access research materials for free, but also potentially make contact with anyone else via email.
   </p>
   <p>
    But by far the most significant developments began in 2004. Facebook and YouTube revolutionised the web by supercharging the concept of user generated content, offering everyone with an internet connection the chance to be the star of their own personal publishing platform. The Social Web was born and it got magnified with ubiquitous mobile internet devices.
   </p>
   <p>
    It’s hard now to remember a time before social media, but its impact simply cannot be overstated. As individuals, it allowed us to build a digital universe around ourselves, as communities sprung up around the content we were posting; incidentally, this was the first step in a gradual shift toward targeted web content, as increasingly we expected our online experience to be personalised and advertisers tailored their content accordingly.
   </p>
   <p>
    So in summary, the latest iteration of the web has brought incredible possibilities, and a plethora of new expectations on our part, and those have been the driving force behind the internet as we now know it.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Great so why change a good thing?
   </h2>
   <p>
    Our current freedom of expression is not truly free. Where third party platforms have given us a loudspeaker, they have equally functioned as a shackle, because our reliance on them gives corporate entities unprecedented power over our society.
   </p>
   <p>
    Have you ever stopped to consider how much personal information you reveal online? Social media is a goldmine of personal information; in fact your posts and likes are already being monetized for advertisers and even political entities. A recent example of this dynamic was the use of Facebook by Boston Analytics to
    <a aria-label=" influence the political landscape (opens in a new tab)" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/facebook-suspends-boston-analytics-firm-over-data-usage/articleshow/65077733.cms?from=mdr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     influence the political landscape
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    On a more day-to-day level, central platforms such as Uber, Paypal or Amazon take an inordinate profit share to act as the middleman in service transactions, leaving very little for the human beings providing those goods and services. Alternatively, we the consumer bear the cost of running the platform. Both of these cases show the inherent conflict of interest baked into our current internet structure.
   </p>
   <p>
    And what about the way we manage our money? When you make a deposit, you place your trust in financial institutions to not only keep your details secure, but to manage and lend your cash responsibly. Think about that -that’s a huge amount of trust! Yet
    <a aria-label=" the 2008 crash (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.thebalance.com/2008-financial-crisis-3305679" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     the 2008 crash
    </a>
    provided a stark warning to all of us that even banks don’t always act in good faith.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    OK but what’s the alternative?
   </h2>
   <p>
    Can you imagine acting as your own bank? Or being able to make online purchases directly from any vendor? This is where
    <a aria-label="Web 3.0 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://youtu.be/NYC3JRBUWew" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     Web 3.0
    </a>
    comes in.
   </p>
   <p>
    Where Web 2.0 has been defined by social interaction, the coming era will be all about digital ownership: no longer will you need to rely on middlemen to purchase goods and services, nor will you need the bank to act as a gatekeeper for your money.
   </p>
   <p>
    Instead, you’ll be able to do all this yourself, from a personal
