   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    What Is a Flash Loan?
   </h2>
   <p>
    A flash loan is an
    <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateralization.asp" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     uncollateralized loan
    </a>
    (meaning the borrower doesn’t need to put up any personal assets as security) where crypto assets are borrowed and repaid immediately in a single, instantaneous transaction. The functionality was first rolled out in 2020 by DeFi protocol
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/series/on-the-ledger/episode-9-aave-the-growth-of-defi-crypto-economy-ws-kulechov" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     AAVE
    </a>
    . It has since been used and developed across the DeFi space. Flash loans are still early to the party so some quirks need to be addressed. But they are nonetheless a very exciting new option native to the crypto industry.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    How Do Flash Loans Work?
   </h2>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    A Loan Based on Results
   </h3>
   <p>
    A flash loan takes advantage of price discrepancies between crypto protocols.
   </p>
   <p>
    For example: maybe you see that exchange X is selling a particular token for $100 dollars, while exchange Y is selling the same token for $101. So you buy the token on exchange X and flip it on exchange Y, making yourself a profit of $1.
   </p>
   <p>
    That one dollar might not seem like a lot – but do that exact same trade on a large scale, by multiplying the trade by 10,000 for example, and you’ll magically make yourself $10,000. The only problem is obtaining the initial, huge upfront capital to purchase the tokens. Who has $100,000 lying around?
   </p>
   <p>
    That’s where flash loans come in.
   </p>
   <p>
    A flash loan is a bespoke smart contract that enables anyone to spot an arbitrage opportunity, and create a loan that enables them to take advantage of that opportunity on a large scale. It allows the user to organize an instantaneous loan, that is based on a specific set of trading conditions. If the fulfillment of the contract conditions would
    <em>
     not
    </em>
    result in the loan being paid back immediately with interest, the agreement simply will not execute.
   </p>
   <p>
    What’s unique about flash loans is that the loan is not granted on the basis of the borrower’s profile, documents or collateral (as with traditional finance and even some loans in DeFi). Instead, on the borrower’s ability to prove an immediate yield from the transaction, based on the smart contract they’ve created.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Smart contracts: the backbone of flash loans
   </h3>
   <p>
    When we talk about flash loans, what we’re really talking about is a smart contract. Every flash loan is basically a bespoke smart contract that agrees to do X if Y happens. In the context of a flash loan, the smart contract operates as follows:
   </p>
   <p>
    If X+10 can be repaid within seconds – something that will depend on the specifics of the arbitrage opportunity itself – then X can be borrowed right now.
   </p>
   <p>
    Hence, to be able to access and receive a flash loan, you need to spot a price discrepancy and immediately write a contract to fit, before the gap closes. If you are feeling confused, don’t worry, we will revisit this later.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Key Features of Flash Loans
   </h2>
   <p>
    So although flash loans may share some similarities with traditional loans, they also have certain distinct features that make them unique.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Zero collateral
   </h3>
   <p>
    Conventional loan systems usually request for collateral before giving loans. There is no need for any form of collateral with flash loans. The contract simply will not execute unless it can immediately be repaid with interest.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Instantaneous transactions
   </h3>
   <p>
    Flash loans are executed instantaneously. They are completed and repaid in a matter of seconds in order to take advantage of fast-moving price fluctuations.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Application of smart contracts
   </h3>
   <p>
    In the case of flash loans, smart contracts govern the transaction, and ensure that the loan is paid back before the transaction is concluded.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Flash Loan Limitations and Risks
   </h2>
   <p>
    If you are already excited at the prospect of creating your first flash loan, there are a few details we should go over first.
