    </a>
    explains tax loss harvesting – one simple way of managing your crypto taxes efficiently. You need to harvest before the end of the year though. Otherwise, you won’t be able to use your losses on this year’s taxes. So let’s dive in and see what crypto tax loss harvesting means, and how it might help you.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    How Crypto Taxes Work
   </h2>
   <p>
    Before we tackle tax loss harvesting, it’s important to define some key terms and concepts, and how those fit into the broader picture of crypto.
   </p>
   <p>
    You can divide personal taxes into two categories: ordinary income tax and capital gains tax. However, the possibility of tax loss harvesting originates from your crypto capital gains. So let’s start by properly unpacking that concept.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    What’s a Crypto Capital Gain?
   </h2>
   <p>
    Generally speaking, ordinary income is money that you earn. In the context of crypto, this could come from staking, lending, airdrops, liquidity pools, royalties, and a variety of other crypto activities. We’ll come back to that.
   </p>
   <p>
    But alternatively, some of the income you make from your crypto holdings might fall into the class of a capital gain. While ordinary income taxes are assessed when
    <em>
     you
    </em>
    make money, capital gains tax is assessed when
    <em>
     your assets
    </em>
    make money. In other words, when an investment goes up or down in value, relative to its original cost basis.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    What’s the Cost Basis?
   </h2>
   <p>
    The original value of an investment is called its “cost basis.” So for example, if you initially bought a given amount of tokens for $1000, you’d have a cost basis for that holding of $1,000.
   </p>
   <p>
    Your capital gains on that holding are calculated by taking the price you sold your coin at and subtracting your cost basis. So for example, if those same tokens then went up in value to $3,000 and subsequently you sold them, you would have made $2,000 in capital gain. This is the amount you would report to your tax authority.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Capital Gains Holding Period
   </h2>
   <p>
    Determining your capital gains tax is not only by the gain you’ve made on your investments but by
    <em>
     how long you held that asset before selling it.
    </em>
    This is otherwise known as your “holding period.” Your holding period will determine whether the gain in question was long-term or short-term which, in turn, determines the rate of tax that will be applied.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the US, taxing on short-term capital gains is done at the ordinary income tax rate. While long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower capital gains rate. Generally, you must hold an asset for at least one year to qualify for the long-term capital gains rate.
   </p>
   <p>
    Where does tax loss harvesting fit into all of this?
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    How Crypto Tax Loss Harvesting Works
   </h2>
   <p>
    As you know, there will be a tax on any capital gains you make. Conversely,
    <em>
     you
    </em>
    can use
    <em>
     losses
    </em>
    to offset gains, reducing your overall tax bill.
   </p>
   <p>
    What’s important is that you can only claim a loss (and benefit from the tax reduction it brings) when you
    <em>
     actually realize the loss
    </em>
    – i.e. when you sell the asset for less than you paid for it.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Tax Loss Harvesting Examples
   </h3>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Capital gains offset
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Let’s say you bought $BTC worth $10,000 two years ago and sell it today for $5,000. You realized a $5,000 long-term capital loss, which you can use to offset up to $5,000 in capital gains in the current tax year. Let’s also say you realized a long-term capital gain of $2,000 on the sale of ETH at the same time. You would not owe tax on your ETH gain because it would be fully offset by your BTC loss.
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Ordinary income offset
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    You can also use capital losses to offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income per year. If you made $60,000 in salary last year and had $5,000 in losses on your cryptocurrency, you can use up to $3,000 of your losses to reduce your ordinary income to $57,000. For most people, that would save them about $1,000 in taxes. Meanwhile, the remaining $2,000 of losses can be “carried forward” and used to reduce your taxes for the next year.
   </p>
   <p>
    These are just two examples of how tax loss harvesting might apply to a given tax return. The overarching message is consistent – knowing the details of how tax works. How certain rules apply to crypto, can directly benefit you.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Knowing What – and When to Sell
   </h2>
   <p>
    <strong>
     A word of caution:
    </strong>
    You need to harvest a loss (e.g., by selling the asset) by December 31st or you won’t be able to use your losses on this year’s taxes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Tax isn’t the easiest subject to understand at the best of times – and can be even trickier when it comes to your crypto portfolio. But luckily, you’re not on your own.
   </p>
   <p>
