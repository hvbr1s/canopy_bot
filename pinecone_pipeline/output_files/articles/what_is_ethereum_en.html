    As the second most popular cryptocurrency, you may have already heard about ETH and the Ethereum network. This
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-blockchain" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     blockchain network
    </a>
    is the home to some of the most successful decentralized projects in history. It has come a long way since its inception, having started life as a proof-of-work blockchain and transitioning into a proof-of-stake blockchain in 2022. However, that’s nowhere near the end of the story for the ETH Network. The blockchain’s poster boy and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said there are many more upgrades in store for the network.
   </p>
   <p>
    But what is the Ethereum network and why is it so popular?
   </p>
   <p>
    Let’s explore and uncover the most important things about Ether and why it’s different from other blockchain networks.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    What Is Ethereum
   </h2>
   <p>
    Ethereum is the blockchain network that introduced the world to real-life use cases of smart contracts and gave rise to decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi). Initially, blockchains were restricted to financial transactions, but Ethereum allowed the scalability needed for developers to build all kinds of software applications and crypto tokens to power multiple ecosystems. In short, it provided people with new use cases.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    The History of Ethereum
   </h2>
   <p>
    The idea behind the Ethereum blockchain was outlined in its Whitepaper in 2013. Vitalik Buterin, its co-founder, envisioned a blockchain where the only limitations for potential use cases would be developers’ creativity. Since its launch in 2015, it quickly rose to become the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, right after
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-bitcoin" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     Bitcoin
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    What is Ether (ETH)?
   </h2>
   <p>
    The native cryptocurrency of this network is named Ether (ETH) Ether (ETH). The smallest unit of Ether is also known as a Wei (0.000,000,000,000,000,001 ETH).  Ether is the coin that fuels all transactions on the network. Every time you transact on an application through your
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/coin/wallet/ethereum" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     Ethereum wallet
    </a>
    , you need to pay a transaction fee in ETH. These transaction fees are known as crypto gas fees. But apart from paying transaction fees, you can also use ETH as a currency for making payments.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Ethereum’s Unique Features
   </h2>
   <p>
    While being decentralized and open-source like many other blockchains, it stood out from the crowd by being the first to offer something called Smart Contracts.
   </p>
   <p>
    But what are smart contracts?
   </p>
   <p>
    To get the full details, read the Ledger Academy article on
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-a-smart-contract">
     what Smart contracts are
    </a>
    , but in essence, you can think of them like computer programs on the blockchain: they generate automatic responses made when certain conditions are met.
   </p>
   <p>
    For example, a smart contract can be set to automatically send 1 ETH to address A once it receives 2 ETH from address B. Due to this, some say Ethereum allows for programmable money. However, once a user deploys a smart contract, it cannot be altered. This is important to maintain the network’s security.
   </p>
   <p>
    So why does it do that and how?
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    How Does Ethereum Work?
   </h2>
   <p>
    Ethereum originally used a
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-proof-of-work" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     Proof of Work
    </a>
    consensus, meaning that Ether was mined similarly to Bitcoin. However, since the Merge in September 2022, it transitioned to a proof of stake mechanism instead. This is now the method the network uses to validate transactions and maintain its security. Meanwhile, the Ethereum Virtual machine (EVM) is responsible for executing the conditions of smart contracts.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Ethereum Proof-of-stake Mechanism
   </h3>
   <p>
    Since Ethereum’s whole
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/consensus-protocols-how-are-blockchains-secure">
     consensus mechanism
    </a>
    changed from Proof-of-Work to
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-proof-of-stake">
     Proof of Stake
    </a>
    (PoS) it now uses validators to create the next block. These network participants must lock a set amount of cryptocurrency on the network which is called
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/basic-basics/keep-growing-it/stake-your-crypto">
     staking
    </a>
    . In doing so, a participant becomes a validator. On the ETH network, participants must stake 32ETH to become a validator. To get into the details, check out the full article on
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/ethereum-proof-of-stake-pos-explained">

    .
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Ethereum Virtual Machine
   </h3>
   <p>
    The Ethereum virtual machine is a virtual computer that runs on all of the nodes in the system. This is the layer of the network that is capable of executing smart contracts, opening the network up to a world of functionality. To learn more about it, check out the full Ledger Academy article on
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/crypto/understanding-ethereum-virtual-machine-evm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     what EVM is
    </a>
    but, essentially, this is what allows the network to support blockchain apps, dApps, DeFi protocols, NFTS, and much more.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Why Is Ethereum So Popular?
   </h2>
   <p>
    The Ethereum network is mainly so popular due to its range of use cases. Since it has the power to execute smart contracts, it’s capable of supporting some particular functionalities.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    DeFi
   </h3>
   <p>
    The Ethereum network is home to some of the most popular DeFi protocols such as Aave, Uniswap, and Curve. This is because Ethereum smart contracts allow for functions such as borrowing, lending, trading, and more. If you want to know more, check out the Ledger Academy article on
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-defi">
     what DeFi is
    </a>
    , but essentially, this functionality opened up a whole new web3 economy. Tokenization means that Ethereum users are even using the network to trade, borrow and lend real-world goods, such as gold or real-world fiat currencies. These capabilities mean that the network hosts over 70% of all DeFi applications.

    DAOs

   <p>
    The Ethereum network also powers several successful and popular Decentralized Autonomous organizations, or DAOs. To learn more, check out the Ledger Academy article on
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-a-dao">
     what a DAO is

    . To explain though, these are communities governed by users with the power of their vote usually decided by tokens they hold. This is a decentralized governance tool with a lot of potential across multiple industries. A good example of a DAO on the Ethereum network includes; MakerDAO. This is the group that governs DAI, a
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-are-stablecoins">

    </a>
    pegged to the dollar. MakerDAO uses its own

    Tokens in The Ethereum Ecosystem
   </h2>
   <p>
    One way that smart contracts are used is by supporting other crypto assets on the Ethereum blockchain. Cryptocurrencies that use the blockchain of another crypto asset rather than having one of their own are not coins, but tokens. Tokens on the Ethereum network are called
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-are-erc-tokens-and-why-do-we-use-them" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     ERC tokens
    </a>
    . ERC tokens come in 3 important forms: Fungible, semi-fungible, and non-fungible.
   </p>
   <p>
    Essentially, ERC-20 tokens are fungible, meaning they can be swapped for one another. The first-ever ERC-20 token, Augur launched back in 2015. Today, the Ethereum blockchain provides the foundation for over 200,000 ERC-20 tokens. Each of these tokens provides a purpose to a different community. Since you can even trade these tokens with each other using decentralized tools, there are several ERC-20 tokens in the

    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    Then ERC-1155 tokens are semi-fungible. This means they come as copies of the same token, just like editions of a piece of artwork. Then finally, there are ERC-721 tokens, unique
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-are-nft" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">

    Ethereum Vs Bitcoin: What’s the Difference?
   </h2>
   <p>
    There are a few key differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin. Firstly, their consensus mechanisms are different. Bitcoin uses a PoW consensus mechanism whereas Ethereum uses PoS consensus mechanism. Then, Ethereum is capable of executing smart contracts, whereas Bitcoin is not. Apart from that, there are tons of differences as to how these blockchains work and what they are for.

    How to Buy ETH
   </h3>
   <p>
    Through the buy feature, you can also use any of Ledger’s partners to buy Ether, or any ERC-20 token securely. Since ERC-20 tokens are ETH-specific, you can store them at your regular crypto address. However, this also means that there is a single
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-are-public-keys-and-private-keys">
     Private Key
    </a>
    to access your Ether and ERC-20 holdings.
   </p>
   <p>
    To buy ETH securely on your Ledger device, install the Ethereum account if you haven’t already. From there, you can
