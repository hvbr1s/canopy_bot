    Consensus mechanisms, Validators, Public Key Cryptography. While all of these terms may seem confusing, it’s important to know what these terms mean and how they affect you when you hold cryptocurrencies. Understanding the core of how the blockchain works will help you make the right decisions, and so, it’s extremely important to know about consensus mechanisms. In short, a consensus mechanism is what keeps the blockchain you know and love secure.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, changing a consensus mechanism also alters the features of a blockchain entirely. For example, those that are more scalable tend to be less secure or decentralized. This is a concept called the
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-the-blockchain-trilemma" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     blockchain trilemma
    </a>
    . While proof-of-work offered the first-ever public blockchain consensus mechanism, it didn’t exactly fit the purposes some crypto enthusiasts were finding for it. Put simply, Bitcoin on its
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-proof-of-work" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     proof-of-work
    </a>
    consensus was too slow and inefficient for blockchain apps and games.
   </p>
   <p>
    As a result, crypto enthusiasts looked for alternatives. The only mentionable content to the Proof of Work consensus was proof-of-stake. In short, it aimed to mirror all the decentralization of the Bitcoin network without massively impeding its security, and many today would say it achieved that feat.
   </p>
   <p>
    But before we get there, let’s go back to basics. In fact, what is Proof-of-Stake exactly?
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    What Is Proof-of-Stake (PoS)?
   </h2>
   <p>
    Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/consensus-protocols-how-are-blockchains-secure" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     consensus mechanism
    </a>
    for blockchain networks that uses randomly selected validators to produce and approve blocks rather than miners. These validators “stake” the native network’s tokens by locking them into the blockchain. In return, they receive rewards based on their total stake, incentivizing nodes to validate the network based on a return on investment (ROI). Put simply, PoS is largely viewed as the greener, and more scalable version of Proof of Work (PoW) consensus in Bitcoin.
   </p>

   </figure>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    How Does Proof-of-Stake Work?
   </h2>
   <p>
    In Proof of Stake blockchains,
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-a-blockchain-validator" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     validators
    </a>
    are selected to produce the next block based on their stake. To explain, to become a validator on a proof-of-stake blockchain, you must “stake” an amount of the corresponding coin. For example, validators on the ETH network must stake 32ETH in order to validate transactions. This stake acts as collateral, ensuring the validator behaves honestly. If they don’t behave well, their stake is “slashed”. To explain,
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/blockchain/what-is-slashing" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     crypto slashing
    </a>
    is a proof-of-stake blockchain’s form of punishment for acting maliciously or producing fake blocks.
   </p>
   <p>
    Usually, the more validator stakes, the more trustworthy they are for the system. Thus, although often designed with random functions to prevent a front-running consensus, these types of validators have a higher chance of producing the next block. Proposed blocks by validators are then propagated to the rest of the set, who verify and add the approved block to the blockchain.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Types of Proof-of-Stake
   </h2>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPOS)
   </h3>
   <p>
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     Delegated Proof of Stake
    </a>
    is a blockchain consensus mechanism where network users vote and elect delegates to validate the next block. Like a traditional proof-of-stake mechanism, DPoS uses a collateral staking system. However, it also uses a specific democratic process that aims to make the transaction process more fair.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPOS)
   </h3>
   <p>
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/blockchain/what-is-nominated-proof-of-stake-npos">
     Nominated Proof-of-Stake
    </a>
    is a variation of the original Proof of Stake mechanism first created for the
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-polkadot" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     Polkadot network
    </a>
    . NPoS works similarly to its parent mechanism, however it also allows token holders to nominate validators to represent them in the block validation process. Only nominated validators can participate in block formation, and each individual nominator can nominate up to a certain number of validators, a total of 16 for the Polkadot network.
   </p>
   <p>
    This is similar to the delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) mechanism in that the network delegates voting power to a third party. However, while DPoS networks use a weighting mechanism to decide power, NPoS networks automatically distribute the stake amongst participating validators evenly. This means both validators and nominators can be punished by the network for malicious activities. Leading to a more balanced share of power between validators and nominators.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Liquid Proof of Stake (LPOS)
   </h3>
   <p>
    Liquid Proof of Stake is a mechanism created specifically for the
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/blockchain/what-is-tezos" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     Tezos network
    </a>
    . It works much like traditional proof-of-stake mechanisms, apart from the validators on these networks are called “bakers”, and instead of “staking” their XTZ, they “bake” it. However, while most proof-of-stake networks use a lock-up period for their staked coins, Tezos does not. In short, you can unstake your XTZ at any time.

   </h2>
   <p>
    Proof-of-Stake blockchains means staking. And staking means rewards. The rules depend on the blockchain you’re using, but there are a few main options.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Native Staking
   </h3>
   <p>
    This involves locking up a significant amount of money and then running the programs required for validating transactions. However, this is usually too high a price for most people to consider. However, if you have the cash you can stake directly via the
    <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4418102254993-Staking-with-a-Ledger-Validator-Node-FAQ-?docs=true" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     Ledger validator node
    </a>
    for yourself.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Pooled Staking
   </h3>
   <p>
    Many platforms let you earn staking rewards simply by locking up your coins in your existing crypto wallet.  It’s important to note that this type of service is also offered on custodial wallets or exchange wallets. These services will essentially validate transactions using your funds as collateral, and then pay you a portion of the rewards. Another name for this is pooled staking. However, make sure that you do your due diligence before using a custodial pooled staking service. That’s because, without the custody of the
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/whats-a-private-key" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     private key
    </a>
    that controls that account, you don’t have true ownership of the funds stored there. That means the platform can change your portion of the rewards at any time.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Fund a Validator
   </h3>
   <p>
    Aside from pooled staking, there are other ways to get involved with staking without doing the whole job yourself. For example, you could also fund a validator. Doing so means someone else will handle the technical details, and make up the rest of their stake elsewhere. This can sometimes be more lucrative, as you will share the rewards with fewer people. However, by funding a validator, you have no idea how nobly they will act. If the validator you fund is malicious and their stake is slashed, your reward goes along with it.

   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Proof-Of-Work Vs Proof-Of-Stake: What’s the Difference?
   </h2>
   <p>
    Firstly, the Proof-of-Stake consensus bypasses the computational lottery-like process of Proof of Work. Instead, it chooses validators (rather than miners) based on their stake. This means that those with the most confidence in the system validate the most transactions and therefore receive the most rewards. This is opposed to proof-of-stake miners, who must solve incredibly complex transactions with specialized equipment.
   </p>
   <p>
    Secondly, PoS has a “fast-finality” consensus design and is more performant both in terms of on-chain transactions per second (TPS) and the actual settlement of network transfers.  This means proof-of-stake blockchains can keep up with a lot more transactions per second, which is imperative for blockchain games and similar apps and platforms.
   </p>
   <p>
    Finally, it is a much less energy-consumptive method than a Proof of Work consensus. Although Bitcoin is often mined using renewable and green energy, Proof-of-stake networks consume almost 90% less energy than their proof-of-work counterparts. This means these types of blockchains are much more effective for everyday use in apps or games. Plus, it also means you don’t need any specialist equipment to validate transactions.

   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Drawbacks of Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
   </h2>
   <p>
    Despite its strengths, Proof-of-Stake – like any technology – is not without its limitations.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    More Centralized than Proof-of-Work
   </h3>
   <p>
    As a system that favours validators with the largest stake, Proof-of-Stake networks will tend toward centralization. With no upper limit on how much one validator can stake, this can lead to significant power being concentrated in the hands of a few very large validators. This makes for a network that is less resistant to potential 51% attacks by validator nodes.
   </p>
   <h3 class="wp-block-heading">
    Not Battle Tested
   </h3>
   <p>
    At the time of writing, although Proof-of-Stake has been successfully used by multiple blockchains, it has never been battle tested to the same scale as Proof-of-Work. Bitcoin and other PoW networks have secured more than $1Trillion – a figure far greater than that stored by current Proof-of-Stake blockchains. With a greater tendency toward centralization, Proof-of-Stake’s capacity to maintain security at this scale is a question worth paying attention to for users and developers alike, and will only be known over time.

    Top Blockchains That Use Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
   </h2>
   <p>
    Proof of Stake networks open up the door for users wanting to accrue awards. Put simply, there’s no crypto staking without Proof-of-Stake. So, before you dive into the technicalities, let’s explore some of the most popular networks for staking. But don’t think that this list is the end of the story. You can also find countless proof-of-stake networks today, such as DASH, NEO or Cardano (ADA).

    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-the-ethereum-shanghai-upgrade" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     Shanghai upgrade
    </a>
    . Not only did this transition reduce its energy consumption by 90% since then. Proof-of-Stake also brought faster transaction speeds and better scalability to the network.
   </p>
   <p>
    Since the transition, new opportunities have arisen for staking ETH. As explained, this supports the security of a proof-of-stake blockchain. To do just that, you have a few options. However, should you choose native staking, bear in mind that validators on the ETH network must stake 32ETH to get going!
   </p>
   <p>
    If that’s not an option, don’t worry – you can also join a staking pool, such as
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-lido" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     Lido
    </a>
    . This means staking a smaller amount of ETH 2.0 to a larger equity pool (in exchange for a small fee), which then issues rewards proportionate to your original stake.

    The
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/blockchain/what-is-tezos">
     Tezos blockchain
    </a>
    is widely known for having one of the biggest ICOs of all time, with nearly $232 million invested in XTZ tokens. Tezos is a multi-purpose blockchain using proof-of-stake.  Specifically, Tezos uses its own version of a PoS consensus called liquid Proof of Stake.
   </p>
   <p>
    To explain, token holders can delegate their accounts to other token holders called validators without transferring ownership of their assets. These validators will then be in charge of securing the network on their behalf. The user may then earn the rewards generated minus the validator’s fees.
   </p>
   <p>
    When delegating, your XTZ remains completely liquid. You are free to move your tokens anytime, as there are no freezing periods when delegating to a validator. Furthermore, there are no direct risks of delegating XTZ. Choosing your validator carefully is enough to easily ensure quality of service and rewards.

    achieves a high rate of transactions per second (TPS) through a Delegated Proof of Stake mechanism.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the Tron network, there are 27 validators that create the blocks on its blockchain. These are called Super Representatives (SR). Everyone participating in the Tron network can use their TRX to vote on who should be a Super Representative. To become a Super Representative, you’d need to have the highest amount of votes. Next, the Super Representative who creates the block gets to choose who to reward. And of course, rewards come in the form of the network coin, TRX.

    ecosystem sets itself as an all-in-one solution to solve scalability and interoperability issues that the blockchain industry has been trying to address. It aims to do so using a hybrid Proof-of-Stake mechanism relying on validators. To explain, on the cosmos network, holding ATOM allows you to vote on who should become a validator. All holders must do is delegate their assets, and in return, they receive rewards. However, it’s important to note that delegating ATOM means locking it up. That said, once you delegate your stake, you can claim your rewards at any time. If you want to know more about staking Cosmos directly with Ledger Live click

    Many Proof-of-Stake chains force you to either become a validator for the network or delegate your cryptocurrencies. This isn’t the case with Algorand. With ALGO, you just need to hold at the very least 1 ALGO on your address and you will automatically start accumulating rewards. That’s it!

    The Future of Proof-of-Stake
   </h2>
   <p>
    Overall, PoS is still one of the most important innovations in the public blockchain sphere. But it’s not just the innovation itself; it’s also led to plenty of other progressive steps forward. For example, Proof-of-Stake has also built the foundations for new consensus mechanisms such as nominated and delegated proof-of-stake.
   </p>
   <p>
    Put simply, the PoS consensus offers the answer to those looking to build upon the security of proof-of-work in a more scalable and energy-efficient way. While Proof-of-Stake is not yet as secure as Proof-of-Work, it has its undisputable advantages for quick transactions and blockchain apps. To explain, proof-of-work blockchains can support more applications. They can handle more transactions in a certain period. And Web3 is still growing, more innovations crop up each day. Proof-of-Stake is unlikely to be the last consensus mechanism you ever hear about.
