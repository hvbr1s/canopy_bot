    <em>
     If you like fantasy football but are busy exploring the world of NFTs, we have just the thing for you. What is Sorare? Here, we explain the exciting next generation of fantasy football.
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    Whether it’s the champions league during the week or league football over the weekend, we all cheer for Messi and Ronaldo when they score goals for their clubs. Our passion for football is limitless.
   </p>
   <p>
    The introduction of fantasy football took massive strides in gamifying this passion. It created a fun medium through which we could actively become a part of the game. But wouldn’t it be better and more fun if you could earn funds and own assets in the game while you play?
   </p>
   <p>
    <br/>
    Today, this gamification is reaching new levels thanks to blockchain technology and NFTs (Non-fungible tokens). And for the first time, you can truly own your! Blurring the lines between fantasy and reality? You bet!
   </p>
   <p>
    Recently, Sorare raised $680 million in a funding round led by SoftBank, taking them to a valuation of $4.3 billion. Looking ahead, Sorare plans on widening the fantasy football community. They also plan on bringing the NFT fantasy sports model to other sports.
    <br/>
    Let’s dive in.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    The Traditional Fantasy Football Model
   </h2>
   <p>
    Firstly, what is fantasy football? In short, fantasy football allows you to play along with your favorite football stars.
   </p>
   <p>
    Before a matchday, you can create your fantasy team by choosing players from a pre-set list. After you have formed your team, you can participate in leagues and compete with your friends.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then, you receive points based on the real-time performance of those players in their games. So, if your striker scores a goal, you earn points. If your goalkeeper saves a penalty, you earn points. Once the game is over, the person with the maximum points wins.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Traditional Fantasy Football: Two Basic Models
   </h2>
   <p>
    —
    <em>
     Free-to-play model: There is no participation or entry fee. It’s ideal for friends to compete with each other without involving any money. After all, the fight is for the bragging rights of who is the better manager!
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    —
    <em>
     Pay-to-play model: You have to pay an amount to enter leagues and competitions. The winners and top performers in these competitions get to go home with profits.
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    Unfortunately, there is no real world or real life benefit of this. For instance, in the EA premier league fantasy competition, there is no added value apart from the entertainment and fun that you receive when you compete with your friends.
   </p>
   <p>
    As fun as it may be, there has always been a void – the players never could own any in-game assets and trade them as they would with real-world objects like playing cards and action figures.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    But All That Changed With Sorare – Here’s How!
   </h2>
   <p>
    Nicolas and Adrian, two employees of a blockchain startup were mesmerized by the idea of empowering humans to collect goods digitally. Their take was that humans have inherently collected rare assets throughout history. But now, thanks to technology, they can do it faster and with more ease.
   </p>
   <p>
    Later, Nicolas (founder) and Adrian (co-founder) gamified the experience of collecting and trading assets on the blockchain by bringing football into the mix!
   </p>
   <p>
    In essence, Sorare, with
    <a aria-label="blockchain technology (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/school-of-block/episode-6-back-to-basics-what-is-blockchain" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     blockchain technology
    </a>
    , makes fantasy football more realistic through the play-to-earn model.
   </p>
   <p>
    Here’s how the founder, Nicolas Julia, describes it in one of his interviews with Bloomberg, “Sorare is a mix between a trading card game and fantasy soccer game.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Rather than plainly choosing your lineup from a roster of players in the traditional approach, Sorare allows you to buy a player’s card whom you want to add to your team.
   </p>
   <p>
    These cards are in the form of NFTs on the
    <a aria-label="Ethereum blockchain (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/ethereum-beginners-guide" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     Ethereum blockchain
    </a>
    . Hence, like any real-world asset, the rarer a card, the more valuable it is going to be!
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    How Does Sorare Benefit You?
   </h2>
   <p>
    What sets Sorare apart from other fantasy football games are the three intrinsic features of Non-Fungible Tokens.
   </p>
   <p>
    — Digital Scarcity – The number of tokens are fixed and cannot be manipulated because the Ethereum network is decentralized and runs on the Proof of Work mechanism.
   </p>
   <p>
    — Authenticity and Traceability – Since NFTs are minted and traded on the blockchain, any person can verify the ownership of the NFT and also trace it back to its origin without hassle.
   </p>
   <p>
    — Portability – Unlike other real world collectibles, NFTs exist digitally and can be effortlessly carried anywhere around the globe.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Here’s How It Works
   </h2>
   <p>
    Say you want to add Courtois, Piqué, and Benzema to your team.
    <br/>
    In the old model, you pick these players from the list using your in-game credits. In Sorare, to add these players to your team, you need to own their corresponding NFTs.
   </p>
   <p>
    Once you
    <a aria-label="own an NFT (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/how-to-secure-your-nfts" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     own an NFT
    </a>
    , you are the sole owner of the card, thus making it an in-game asset. You can then add the card to your line-up, participate in leagues and competitions, and even trade or sell them!
   </p>
   <p>
    Of course, since you are the sole owner of the NFTs, they are never going to expire!
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
