    <em>
     Blockchain is about restoring control and autonomy to you, the user – and Ledger makes sure the power stays in your hands.
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    Crypto is all about having control of your own value. In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto revolutionized the financial world by developing the first ever digital currency that is not reliant on any centralized institution, such as banks, governments, or a company that acts as a guardian for keeping asset holdings and transactions.
   </p>
   <p>
    This was a direct jab at banks, as Nakamoto eternalized his view on the centralized banking system and fiat money in the Bitcoin
    <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/a-deep-dive-into-satoshis-11-year-old-bitcoin-genesis-block/">
     genesis block
    </a>
    . His problem was that the traditional banking and finance system is built entirely on trust. Throughout history, this trust has been shattered more often than not.
   </p>
   <p>
    The last instance of this was during the financial crisis of 2007/08. This brought up many trust issues, such as misappropriated funds, falsified corporate reports, losses due to inadequate investment advice, customers who were unable to withdraw their bank deposits, and bankers who stuffed their own pockets over the biggest financial disaster of the early 21st century.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thanks to its design, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies function in a completely trustless fashion without any of these centralized middlemen. Finally, you can be your own bank. With crypto, you can receive, hold, and send money without needing a third party to facilitate these transactions.
   </p>
   <p>
    Over time, a whole new financial system has emerged in the form of
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-defi">
     decentralized finance (DeFi)
    </a>
    , which has the ambitious goal to fix the various shortcomings of the traditional, centralized financial world. Thanks to all of this, you can already enjoy an unprecedented level of financial freedom and the development of the cryptoeconomy is far from over.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Would you give your car key to a stranger?
   </h2>
   <p>
    When you hold any of the many different digital assets that are recorded on a public
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-blockchain#:~:text=A%20blockchain%20is%20a%20distributed,anyone%20with%20an%20Internet%20connection.">
     blockchain
    </a>
    , you are already on your way to
    <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-true-financial-freedom">
     financial freedom
    </a>
    . This puts you in the driver’s seat of your personal finances and provides you with a plethora of opportunities that you can use in order to grow your wealth. But what good does it to be in the driver’s seat, if you can’t start the car? If you really want to maximize your financial freedom, there are some pitfalls that you need to avoid.
   </p>
   <p>
    Remember, financial freedom also means freedom from banks and other financial service providers. Thanks to crypto, you can be your own bank, but this requires some extra work on your behalf. Your cryptocurrency wallet is secured by two cryptographic pairs: a public and a private one. While you are free to hand out your public key to others, so that they can send you money, you should make absolutely sure that nobody else but you knows and owns your
    <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000380313-Manage-your-private-keys-own-your-crypto">
     private key.
    </a>
   </p>
   <p>
    Most services that facilitate crypto dealings are at least partially centralized. Essentially, every time you give your crypto into custody at one of these service providers, you are giving away control over your coins and the private key that secures your coins. Always remember, if you don’t own the private key, you don’t own your money.
   </p>
   <p>
    Think of the private key as the key for your car. When you give the only key to someone else, that other person can get in your car at will and drive away. In the worst case, you will never see that other person and your car again. At the same time, if you want to drive away yourself, you have to ask the person who has the key for permission and there is no way to make sure that you will be allowed to drive off. If you keep your key, you are free to do whatever you want.
   </p>
   <h2 class="wp-block-heading">
    Not your key? Not your coins!
   </h2>
   <p>
    Exactly the same applies to your crypto funds. The threat of losing your funds on custodial providers is very real. From
    <a href="https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/mt-gox-hack/">
     exchange hacks
    </a>
    and insolvencies to
    <a href="https://beincrypto.com/quadrigacx-operated-like-a-revolving-door-before-going-bankrupt-canadian-regulators/">
     embezzlement on behalf of the exchange owner
    </a>
    , numerous people have lost a good amount of money, just because they trusted the wrong custodian.
   </p>
   <p>
    When you first bought crypto, you likely used a centralized exchange for this purpose. If you decide to keep your coins on the exchange, the exchange is in control of your funds. Always when you give crypto into custody, the custodian owns the money, instead of you.
   </p>
   <p>
    Like with banks, you have to absolutely trust these service providers to handle your money with the necessary care. Very often, this trust has been shattered by hackers or unethical business practices on behalf of the service provider. The most secure and trusted way to keep ownership of your private key and thus your digital assets is to use a hardware wallet, such as
    <a href="https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s">
     Ledger Nano S
    </a>
    or
    <a href="https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-x">
     Ledger Nano X

    .
