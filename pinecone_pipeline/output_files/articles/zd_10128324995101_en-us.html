<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Your One-Time Security Code provides an additional level of security to Ledger Recover. The code will be displayed on the Ledger device that you're using to restore access to your wallet. You'll be asked to provide the code during the identity verification process. If you can't provide the code, you'll need to start over. Each One-Time Security Code can only be used once. If you start over, you'll get a different code.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Here are some tips to help you:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0e101a;">Note down the code and keep it close to you.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #0e101a;">Allow access to your camera and microphone.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #0e101a;">Choose the language in which you feel most comfortable saying the code.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #0e101a;">Say one number at a time in a quiet place with a stable internet connection.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #0e101a;">Do not share or use the code in any other way. Only use a code that is displayed on your Ledger device.</span></li>
