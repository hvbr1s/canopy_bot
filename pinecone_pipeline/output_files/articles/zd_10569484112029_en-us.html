<h2 id="h_01HCA8QYD9B2Y52CE6ARAFRMDC"><span>Where is the Lido app located?</span></h2>
<p><span>You can find the Lido app in the <strong>Discover</strong> section of Ledger Live.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/14069021949853"></p>
<p><span>The Lido app is also accessible directly on <a href="https://stake.lido.fi/withdrawals/request" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lido's website</a>, but for optimal security, we recommend using Lido within Ledger Live.</span></p>
<p><span>If you prefer not to use the Lido app, you can still securely swap stETH for ETH (which achieves the same result as unstaking stETH) using <strong>Paraswap</strong>, also found in the Discover section of Ledger Live. Learn more about swapping with Paraswap <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020907378-Swap-crypto-with-Paraswap?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</span></p>
<h2 id="h_01HCA8G42K6YJ21PZCARERDNT1">How long does it take for the withdrawal to process?</h2>
<p><span>Withdrawals via the Lido app typically take between <strong>1 to 5 days to process</strong>.

<h2 id="h_01HCA98HBYREH96H0YW9RV7K9J"><span>What is the Lido NFT? </span></h2>
<p><span>With Lido, your withdrawal request is represented by an NFT, minted upon signing the request transaction with your Ledger device. </span></p>
<p><span><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/14114550531357"><br><br></span></p>
<p><span>This NFT will be stored in your Ethereum (ETH) account and will <strong>change appearance</strong> when your ETH is ready to be claimed. <br><br></span><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/14114581152797" width="193" height="186"></p>
<p><span>There might be occasional delays in Ledger Live reflecting this change of appearance; if so, verify your NFT's status using <strong>Rainbow.me</strong>, located in the <strong>Discover</strong> section of Ledger Live.<br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/14114571010589"><br></span></p>
<p><span>After claiming your ETH, the NFT will be burnt.

<p>You may receive unsolicited NFT airdrops that appear to be legitimate Lido or stETH NFTs, promising free money if redeemed on a third-party website. These NFTs often contain <strong>links to external sites</strong>.<br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/14069664522269"></p>
<p><span>Be warned: these NFTs are <strong>scams.</strong> Their aim is to lure you to third-party sites or apps where you'll be asked to share your 24-word recovery phrase or to sign a malicious transaction with your Ledger device, granting the scammer access to your accounts.</span></p>
<p><span>When faced with an unwanted stETH or Lido NFT with links, it's best to <strong>observe the following rules</strong>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>NEVER</strong> share or type your 24-word recovery phrase into any website or app. This phrase is the master key to all your accounts. Anyone gaining access to it could compromise your accounts and steal your funds.</span></li>
<li><span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Avoid any interaction with links or websites associated with the NFT.</span></span></li>
<li><span>Do <strong>not</strong> send the NFT to another account or a burner address. Doing so requires interaction with the NFT's underlying smart contract, which could be malicious.</span></li>
<li><span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Simply <strong>hide</strong> the NFT in Ledger Live by <strong>right-clicking</strong> on the NFT then selecting <strong>Hide NFT Collection.<br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/14069643316893"><br></strong></span></span></li>
