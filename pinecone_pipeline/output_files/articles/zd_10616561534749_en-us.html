<p>This notification is shown to users who utilized the outdated Device Bridge connection method to access their Ledger accounts through MetaMask. Initially, the Device Bridge was introduced to assist users who encountered U2F connectivity issues.</p>
<p>However, with the advent of WebHID as the primary transport method used by most websites to interact with hardware wallets, the Device Bridge has been phased out in the latest iterations of Ledger Live. As a result, users are required to switch to WebHID for seamless connectivity</p>
<h2 class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">How to connect with WebHID? </h2>
