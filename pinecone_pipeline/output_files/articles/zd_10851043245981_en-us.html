<p>This article explains why you may see very high network fees when receiving BTC from the exchange to your Ledger.</p>
<h2>High network fees</h2>
<p>Once you received some BTC from the exchange (eg. Coinbase, Binance, etc), you may see high network fees for this particular transaction.<strong> It is normal to see the high fees for receiving from exchanges. </strong></p>
<p>These are so-called<strong> payment batching.</strong></p>
<p>The process of batching refers to <strong>combining multiple payments (withdrawals) into a solitary transaction that has numerous outputs.</strong> This method can reduce the data overhead for the transaction, which is the primary factor determining Bitcoin fees. By merging several transactions into a single one, it is possible to lower data usage and consequently cut down on fees that the exchange has to pay.</p>
<p>The fees for this consolidated transaction are shown in Ledger Live, which may give the impression that you paid a higher fee. However, upon checking the block explorer link within Ledger Live, it becomes apparent that the exchange covered the transaction fees by sending BTC to several addresses/users of the exchange at the same time.</p>

<h2 data-slate-object="block" data-key="19"><span data-slate-object="text" data-key="18">Who pays network fees on receiving?</span></h2>
<p><span data-slate-object="text" data-key="18">Good to remind you that when you are receiving funds in Ledger Live, from exchanges or not, you never pay the network fees indicated in the transaction on the explorer. </span></p>
<p><strong>The network fees are always paid by the sender of the transaction. </strong></p>
<p>If you are receiving from the exchange, you only pay the withdrawal fees set by the exchange during the withdrawal process.</p>
<h2>Seeing high network fees on sending?</h2>
<p><strong>Bitcoin network may get very congested from time to time</strong> and it can result in high network fees and can lead your send transactions to get stuck as pending. </p>
