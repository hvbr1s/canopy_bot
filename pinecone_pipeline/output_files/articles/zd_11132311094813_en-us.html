<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Most of Ledger’s products are already open source, with many developers contributing to Ledger Live, Ledger devices, and more. Together, we built over 150 open-source apps that run on different Ledger devices, on top of our OS and the Secure Element, and integrating into our stack and </span><a href="https://developers.ledger.com/docs/embedded-app/introduction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">building an embedded application</a><span style="color: #0e101a;"> is easy. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">The following components of our OS code are available for review:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-secure-sdk/tree/master/lib_cxng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our cryptography library</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.ledger.com/docs/embedded-app/crypto-api/introduction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cryptography library documentation</a></li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-secure-os" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OS commands dispatcher</a><span style="color: #0e101a;"> </span>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-secure-os/blob/main/dashboard/src/dashboard_recover.c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Entry points of Ledger Recover implementation</a></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">We’ll gradually make more of our OS components available for review and verifiability, and we plan to work on refactoring the code so that we can abstract the chip-specific characteristics under NDA from our OS.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">In addition, Donjon - our team of world-class security experts - runs a </span><a href="https://donjon.ledger.com/bounty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bug bounty program</a><span style="color: #0e101a;"> to reward researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. Providing more OS components for review helps external security researchers audit our products. The research work will be publicly documented.</span></p>
<h2 id="h_01HDDSAC3M32E5WSSBQEB5ZSFF"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Why we cannot open source our Secure Element</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Making more of our source code components available, reviewable, and auditable has always been at the core of our roadmap, and we emphasize the importance of accelerating our initiative to bring greater verifiability to everything we do at Ledger.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Ledger devices use smartcard chips called Secure Elements (SE) — the advanced technology implementing several hardware countermeasures against potential attacks even with physical access.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">As part of their security capabilities, Secure Elements allow businesses to implement a robust root of trust through this protection and prove that their products are genuine and not tampered with, including in complex supply chain environments.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">The full range of SE's security capabilities are part of manufacturers' Intellectual Property (IP) and are not accessible to third parties. Companies like us at Ledger, that work with this type of hardware need to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) that prevents revealing confidential and security-sensitive information. This is the primary reason why Ledger is unable to disclose its entire OS source code.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Here at Ledger, we strongly believe in an open source and verifiable code approach. It's a great philosophy that advocates openness, transparency and verifiability, some of our core values.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">That's why we're constantly working towards making source code components available, reviewable, and auditable.</span></p></body></html>
