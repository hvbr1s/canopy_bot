<p>This article provides instructions to resolve an "invalid address error" that may occur when withdrawing XRP from exchanges like Coinbase to your XRP account in Ledger Live. </p>
<h2 class="p1">Understanding the X-address Format</h2>
<p>Occasionally, exchanges may demand the use of an <strong>X-address</strong> for XRP transfers, a format distinct from the usual R-address used in Ledger Live. To ensure successful XRP withdrawals, you might need to convert your current R-address to this X-address format.</p>
<p>In addition, some exchanges may ask for <strong>both an x-address and a memo</strong>. Even though it isn't obligatory to add a memo when moving funds to your Ledger wallet, you can fill in any sequence of characters or digits like '0000' or '1111' if it's requested.</p>

<h4 class="callout__title"><strong><em class="fa fa-info-circle"> </em>Important note for Coinbase users</strong></h4>
<span>Coinbase has stopped supporting XRP transfers to X-addresses, and trying to do so will result in an '<strong>Invalid address</strong>' error. For successful transfers, please <strong>make sure to use your regular R-address</strong> as provided by your Ledger device and Ledger Live.<br></span><br><span><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/12659373657885" alt="invalid_xrp.png" width="523" height="254"></span><br><br>

<h4 class="callout__title"><strong><em class="fas fa-info-circle"> </em>Try a test transaction first</strong></h4>
<p>To minimize any potential risks, we strongly recommend testing the newly converted X-address by sending a small amount of XRP first. This allows you to verify that the XRP successfully reaches your Ledger Live account before proceeding with larger transactions.</p>
