<p>The message <strong>insufficient device storage</strong> may appear when trying to install an app or firmware update on your Ledger Nano device. You can uninstall apps you don't need. Uninstalling apps does not affect your crypto assets.</p>
<h2>Uninstall apps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Open My Ledger<strong> </strong>in the Ledger Live application.</li>
<li>Check on the screen of your Ledger Nano which apps are installed. Pick a few to uninstall.</li>
<li>Find the apps to uninstall in the <strong>App catalog</strong> in Ledger Live.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Trash</strong> button for each app to uninstall.</li>
<li>Install the apps you want to use.</li>
</ol>

<em class="fa fa-info-circle"> </em> How apps work</h4>
<p>Ledger devices securely store the private keys giving access to your crypto assets. Each app on the device lets you manage a crypto asset. <em>Example: To manage Bitcoin, install the Bitcoin app.</em></p>
<p>Your device has limited storage. You can safely uninstall and install apps within seconds without losing access to your crypto assets. Your private keys stay safe on your device and on your Recovery sheet.</p>
<p>Your crypto assets are not stored in the apps, they are secured on the blockchain.</p>
</div>
<h2>The number of installable apps varies</h2>
<p>There are two different types of apps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Stand-alone apps:</strong> These tend to be larger in size. Examples are Bitcoin and Ethereum.</li>
<li>
<strong>Dependent apps:</strong> These are based on a stand-alone app and are therefore smaller. You can install many of them at the same time, <em>stacking</em> them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How much memory does my device have?</h2>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">When using Ledger hardware wallets, the available storage capacity varies depending on the model you have. For example, the Ledger Nano S Plus offers 1.5 MB of storage space, while the Ledger Nano X provides 2 MB. This storage space is primarily used to </span><a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/articles/360011454079-What-are-apps-and-accounts-?docs=true"><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline" style="color: #1155cc; background-color: #ffffff;">install applications</span></strong></a><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> for different cryptocurrencies, and the number of applications you can have is limited by each app's size. Each device can hold up to 100 apps. Explore our device specifications </span><a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/articles/360015259693-Choose-your-Ledger-device?docs=true"><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline" style="color: #1155cc; background-color: #ffffff;">here</span></strong></a><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. </span></p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">How much crypto can I store?</span></h2>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">The storage capacity of a Ledger device does not determine the amount of cryptocurrency it can "hold." Instead, our hardware wallets securely store your private keys offline, which are essential for accessing your cryptocurrencies on the blockchain. <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto/where-are-my-coins#:~:text=Your%20coins%20are%20associated%20with,custodian%20of%20your%20own%20money."><span class="wysiwyg-underline" style="color: #1155cc;">The actual cryptocurrencies are not stored on the device itself, but rather, on the respective blockchains</span></a>.</span></p>
<div class="callout callout--primary">
<h4 class="callout__title"><strong><em class="fa fa-info-circle"> </em>Important note</strong></h4>
While Ledger devices may store up to 2 MB of apps, this storage capacity is not correlated to the amount of a specific asset you own. <strong>This means you can hold a small fraction of a Bitcoin or the entire amount in circulation.</strong>
</div>
<p>Owning cryptocurrency grants you a private key, which serves as the means to sign transactions and access your crypto assets on the blockchain.</p>
<p>A Ledger device, like the Ledger Nano S Plus or X, functions as a hardware wallet designed to safeguard your private keys offline. When conducting a transaction, the device internally signs it, ensuring your private keys remain protected from any online exposure. This added security layer effectively shields your assets from potential hacks and theft.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">As a result, <strong>the amount of cryptocurrency you can manage with a Ledger device is not constrained by its storage capacity</strong>. Instead, you can conveniently and securely manage an almost unlimited amount of cryptocurrencies using our devices, ensuring your digital assets remain safe, secure and easy to manage. </span></p></body></html>
