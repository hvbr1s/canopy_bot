<p><span style="color: #434343;">This article answers frequently asked questions about the Earn section.Â </span><span style="color: #434343;"></span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="color: #434343;"><iframe src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AMLDI1P0GYU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></span></p>
<h2 id="h_01H9TKV1HN92ZVZHXDXRD5XMQM"><span style="color: #434343;">What is the Earn section, and how does it work?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">The Earn section of the Ledger Live app allows you to track rewards* and discover staking opportunities across chains without navigating multiple platforms and interfaces. In the Earn section, you can easily see all your staked and eligible for staking assets, APR/APY, and earned rewards.</span></p>
<div class="callout callout--primary">
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Annual Percentage Yield (APY)</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Â is an estimate of what you'll earn on your staked assets each year, including compound interest as the rewards accumulate.Â </span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Annual Percentage Return (APR)</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Â is an estimate of the total yearly rewards you can expect on your staked assets without compound interest.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Keep in mind that the generated rewards may vary from the </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">estimated rewards.Â </span></p>
</div>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">The Earn section consists of two tabs:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">Assets earning rewards</span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;"> tab allows you to track rewards on assets you are currently staking.</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">Earn more rewards</span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;"> tab shows the list of your assets that are eligible for staking, along with the estimated rewards you would receive. From there, you can buy more assets, click </span><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">Stake</span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;"> and start earning rewards.</span>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h_01H9TKV1HNWA3TVJC9XRM1YGWG"><span style="color: #434343;">What assets are supported in the Earn section?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">The Earn section currently provides data for all staking positions and validators for </span><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">Solana (SOL), Tezos (XTZ), Ethereum (ETH), </span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">and</span><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;"> Ethereum Lido Staking (STETH), </span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">with more to come.</span></p>
<h2 id="h_01H9TKV1HN7C2N6ZWHP4F0H3VY"><span style="color: #434343;">Why do some assets that I can stake through Ledger Live don't appear in the Earn section?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Because the Earn section doesn't support them yet. We're working hard on adding support for more coins.Â </span></p>
<h2 id="h_01H9TKV1HPD14Y634PMPY8B922"><span style="color: #434343;">Does the Earn section provide real-time data?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">The Earn section relies on third-party service providers to fetch the latest data. Keep in mind that each chain is different, and some take longer to fetch data than others. Data on staked amounts are updated every five minutes at most. Rewards are updated once a day.</span></p>
<h2 id="h_01H9TKV1HP0W08SK0JK3VSPM85"><span style="color: #434343;">What are the next steps for the Earn section?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">We'll be adding support for more coins including Cardano (ADA), Near (NEAR), and assets from the Cosmos ecosystem.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Additionally, we will provide detailed information about the validators youâ€™re using and their reward performance. We also plan to add features such as DeFi, and lending in the future. Stay tuned! </span></p>
