<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Earn section is a feature of the Ledger Live app that allows you to track your rewards* and discover staking opportunities across chains without navigating multiple platforms and interfaces. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">To access the Earn section:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #0e101a;">Open the Ledger Live desktop app.</span></li>
<li>
<span style="color: #0e101a;">In the left navigation bar, click </span><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">Earn</span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">.</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Once you land on it, you’ll see that the Earn section consists of two tabs:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">Assets earning rewards</span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;"> tab allows you to track rewards on assets you are currently staking.</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">Earn more rewards</span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;"> tab shows the list of your assets that are eligible for staking, along with the estimated rewards you would receive. From there, you can buy more assets, click </span><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">Stake</span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;"> and start earning rewards.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">The Earn section currently provides data for all staking positions and validators for </span><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">Solana (SOL), Tezos (XTZ), Ethereum (ETH), and Ethereum Lido Staking (STETH)</span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">.</span></p>
