<p>If some of your Polkadot (DOT) transactions are not appearing in your Ledger Live transaction history, this may be due to a synchronization issue. Attempt <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404381846929-Clear-cache-in-Ledger-Live?support=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clearing the cache</a> in Ledger Live to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>Should the problem continue, cross-verify the transaction on a block explorer such as <a href="https://polkadot.subscan.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subscan.io</a>. If the transaction and balance appear accurate on subscan.io, it's likely that the transaction type isn't detected by Ledger Live, causing it to be omitted from your history.</p>
<p>Please note, Ledger Live is <strong>not able to detect certain transaction types</strong>, such as 'Transfer_allow_death' or 'Batch_all'.<br><br></p>
