<p>Solana users in Ledger Live may occasionally encounter the error message: "<strong>Sorry, internet seems to be down: Transaction results in an account (0) without insufficient funds for rent</strong>" when trying to send or stake Solana (SOL) coins.</p>
<p>This issue arises when your account attempts to spend or unstake the entirety of your SOL balance. Solana accounts, however, require a certain amount to be retained for rent to maintain activity. For a better understanding of Solana's rent concept, refer to <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://docs.solana.com/developing/intro/rent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this article</a>.</p>
<p><span>To resolve this issue, simply deselect '<strong>Send Max</strong>' or '<strong>Use Max</strong>' when sending or staking SOL coins.</span><br><br></p>

<p><span>You may encounter a similar '<strong>Sorry, internet seems to be down</strong>' error when trying to withdraw an inactive SOL stake if your <strong>Available balance</strong> doesn't have enough SOL to cover the transaction fee. To resolve this, ensure you have some SOL in your available balance</span><br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/12939225404317"></p>
