<p>This tutorial describes how to manage bags lists with polkadot.js.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HAS8Y0BVEEMJ1Y2W9ZDW4MAR">What are bags lists? </h2>
<p>Introduced in March 2022, the "bags list" system sorts nominating accounts into "bags" based on the amount of DOT staked. Only the top 22,500 accounts are factored into the reward algorithm, making the minimum staked amount required for rewards* a dynamic figure (equivalent to <strong>502 DOT</strong> coins as of November, 2023). If your DOT stake surpasses this minimum amount but you're not seeing rewards, it's possible that your account is not optimally positioned within its bag. As a result, your account may be inadvertently bypassed during the reward process. <strong>This is especially the case if you've recently added DOT coins to your bonded stake</strong>.

<li>Follow <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403056215825-Set-up-and-use-polkadot-js-to-access-your-Ledger-Polkadot-DOT-accounts?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these steps</a> to connect your Ledger device to polkadot.js.</li>
<li>Once your Ledger is connected, go to <strong>Network</strong> &gt; <strong>Staking</strong> and select the <strong>Bags</strong> tab.<br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/12754272393501"><br><br>

</ol>
<h2 id="h_01HAS8Y0BVF61PQD84AN3XWK73">I am not able to see the Move up option</h2>
<p><span>It may take <strong>up to 20 minutes</strong> for the <strong>Move up</strong> option to appear in the interface. However, you can potentially expedite this by switching to a different connecting node. </span></p>
<p><span>To do so, click on the Polygon <strong>logo</strong> in the top left corner, choose a different node, and confirm your selection by pressing the <strong>Switch</strong> button. Additionally, the Move up option might not show up if you've recently re-bagged your stake.</span><br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/12754536659741"><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/12754516722589"><br><br></p>
