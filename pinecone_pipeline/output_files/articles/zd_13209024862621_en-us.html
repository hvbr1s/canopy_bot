<p><span>You may receive unsolicited NFT airdrops that appear to be <strong>vouchers</strong>, promising free money if redeemed on a third-party website. These NFTs often contain <strong>links</strong> to external sites.</span><br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/13209272872477"></p>

<p><span>Be warned: these NFT vouchers are <strong>scams.</strong> Their aim is to lure you to third-party sites or apps where you'll be asked to share your 24-word recovery phrase or to sign a malicious transaction with your Ledger device, granting the scammer access to your accounts.</span></p>
<p><span>When faced with an unwanted NFT voucher with links, it's best to <strong>observe the following rules</strong>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>NEVER</strong> share or type your 24-word recovery phrase into any website or app. This phrase is the master key to all your accounts. Anyone gaining access to it could compromise your accounts and steal your funds.</span></li>
<li><span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Avoid any interaction with links or websites associated with the NFT</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> </span></span></li>
<li><span>Do <strong>not</strong> send the NFT to another account or a burner address. Doing so requires interaction with the NFT's underlying smart contract, which could be malicious.</span></li>
<li><span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Simply <strong>hide</strong> the NFT in Ledger Live by <strong>right-clicking</strong> on the NFT then selecting <strong>Hide NFT Collection.<br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/13209263440797"></strong></span></span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">I followed a link to a malicious website</span></h2>
<p><span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Clicking or following a link embedded in a malicious NFT is not enough to compromise your wallet. The only scenarios that place your wallet at risk are sharing or typing out your 24-word recovery phrase, or signing a malicious transaction with your Ledger device.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">If you suspect you've signed a malicious transaction using your Ledger device, act quickly.
