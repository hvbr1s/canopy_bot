<p>Airdrops have gained popularity as a way to distribute new tokens or coins to existing holders of a specific cryptocurrency. If you own that particular cryptocurrency, like many Ledger users do, you may receive free tokens from a newly launched project. Ledger users are especially well-positioned for airdrops because Ledger activity is all on-chain, and you have a real crypto address that you own. Compare this to centralized exchange (CEX) users who don’t control an address of their own, and most activity happens only within the CEX platform and not on-chain. The ownership and on-chain activity that the Ledger ecosystem provides increases the likelihood of being eligible for and receiving airdrops.</p>
<p>However, it's essential to be cautious because not all airdrops can be trusted, especially when their origins are unclear. This article provides guidance on how to safely participate in airdrops and offers tips for maintaining security in airdrop situations, where scams are common.</p>
<h2 id="h_01H9NQ7FTAYJ2TQBCVN8J76W5E"><span>Can I receive airdrops as a Ledger user? </span></h2>
<p>Absolutely, as a Ledger user,<strong> you can receive airdrops</strong>. Your on-chain transaction history and control over your crypto addresses provide you with opportunities to participate in different airdrop campaigns. To claim an airdrop, you will generally want to follow the instructions provided by the official airdrop website. You may need to connect to the website via WalletConnect, or use a third-party wallet to orchestrate a claim. For high-profile airdrops, Ledger support will often post a guide, so definitely search our Help Center if you feel like you need help. If in doubt, Ledger support is happy to help answer your questions.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when engaging in airdrop activities,<strong> it is imperative to exercise vigilance and verify the authenticity of these opportunities to steer clear of potential scams</strong>.</p>
