<p>Â </p>
<p><span>This guide will walk you through the process of transferring coins and tokens <strong>between your Ledger accounts within Ledger Live</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Please be aware this tutorial specifically addresses transfers between two Ledger accounts <strong>on the same blockchain network</strong>. If you're looking to move ERC20 tokens from one network to another (e.g., Ethereum to Polygon or Arbitrum to Optimism), we recommend utilizing a bridging service like <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/11672700084509-How-to-swap-crypto-with-Squid-through-Ledger-Live?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Squid</a>, which can be found in the <strong>Discover</strong> section of Ledger Live. For direct coin swaps (e.g. Bitcoin (BTC) to Ethereum (ETH) or XRP) consider using <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404381458065?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Changelly</a>, found in the Swap section of Ledger Live.<br></span></p>

<p><span>Here's how to transfer crypto between two Ledger accounts on the <strong>same blockchain network</strong>, be it Bitcoin to Bitcoin, Ethereum to Ethereum, Solana to Solana, and so on:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Launch the Ledger Live app and head over to the <strong>destination</strong> account..</span><br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/13631481216413"><br><br>
</li>
<li>
<span>Within that account, click on <strong>Receive</strong>.</span><br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/13631492055837"><br><br>
</li>
<li>
<span><strong>Copy</strong> the displayed destination address and ensure it matches the address displayed on your Ledger device.</span><br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/13631573972381"><br><br>
</li>
<li>
<span>Navigate back to the <strong>Accounts</strong> section and select the account you want to send from.</span><br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/13631603350941"><br><br>
</li>

<span>Within that account, click <strong>Send</strong> and paste the previously copied destination address into the <strong>Recipient address</strong> field.</span><br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/13631682841373"><br><br>
</li>
<li>
<span>Choose the <strong>amount</strong> you wish to transfer and select the <strong>transaction fees</strong> then review the transaction details on your Ledger device. If everything is accurate, <strong>confirm</strong> the transaction by pressing the buttons on your Ledger device.</span><br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/13631726731421"><br><br><span>Once the transaction is successfully broadcasted, you'll see a confirmation message in Ledger Live.</span><br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/13631753027613"><br><br><span>After the network confirms the transaction, your destination account balance will update to reflect the transferred amount. Do note that <strong>confirmation times vary</strong> based on factors like block time and network congestion. For instance, while Bitcoin may take longer to confirm, networks like Solana are typically faster.</span>
