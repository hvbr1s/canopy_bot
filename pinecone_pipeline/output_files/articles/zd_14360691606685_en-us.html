<p>Ledger Recover sessions have an associated Support Reference which allows Ledger Support to troubleshoot issues you may face during Backup and Restore sessions. You can find your customer tag in the bottom right corner of your screen during the Backup and Restore process.</p>
<p>If you have issues while using Restore and need to contact Ledger support, please make note of your Support Reference and share it with Ledger support when opening a ticket through our chatbot.</p>
