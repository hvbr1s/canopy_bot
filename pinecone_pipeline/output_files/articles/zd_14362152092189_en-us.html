<p>This issue signifies that Ledger Live is unable to establish communication with the Bitcoin blockchain. Such difficulties often arise during periods of high congestion on the Bitcoin network, which can inundate the Ledger Live app and its underlying server infrastructure, leading to problems.</p>
<p>Rest assured that this issue does not compromise the safety of your funds; it is strictly a network connectivity issue within Ledger Live.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HDGDG6FHP9Q4X8D8T5JX88KN">Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>Here are several methods to resolve this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Consider waiting for the activity on the Bitcoin network to subside before attempting your transaction again. The network activity can be monitored at <a href="https://mempool.space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://mempool.space</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatively, connect your Ledger device to a third-party alternative to Ledger Live, such as <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005161925?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electrum</a> or <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/10615436599837-Connect-your-Ledger-to-Bitcoin-BTC-network-with-Sparrow?support=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sparrow</a> and try your transaction again.</p>
