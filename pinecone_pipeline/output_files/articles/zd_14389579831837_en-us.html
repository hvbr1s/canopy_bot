<p>When you hold crypto on an exchange, it's the exchange that creates and manages accounts on your behalf and controls your private keys.</p>
<p>With Ledger, you create your own crypto accounts and control the private keys. </p>
<p>In this article, we explain step-by-step how you can withdraw crypto from Kraken to your Ledger wallet.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HDK9C4J0Q2CZX7MSEFHR59X9"><span style="color: #434343;">Log in to your Kraken account</span></h2>
<ol class="list-colored">
<li>Go to Kraken.com and log in to your account.</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #0e101a;">Navigate to </span><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">Funding</span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;"> → </span><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">Withdraw</span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">.</span>
</li>
<li><span style="color: #0e101a;">Use the search bar to find the crypto asset you want to withdraw to your Ledger wallet. </span></li>
</ol>
<p>Now it’s time to generate your Ledger deposit address. But before doing so, you first need to select the correct network. </p>
<div class="callout callout--primary">
<h4 id="h_01HDKA64ZRXN7BPZHGVRE9EN8P" class="callout__title"><strong>What is a network?</strong></h4>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The network is another term for blockchain. Crypto assets run on networks. In fact, some crypto assets can run on multiple networks. Before withdrawing your crypto from Kraken, you need to know which network it runs on. You should withdraw your crypto to Ledger wallet using a supported blockchain.</span></p>
</div>
<h3 id="h_01HDK9FE34387RKVBN1RNGA5R9"><span style="color: #666666;">Selecting the correct network</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">In most cases, Kraken automatically matches the address to the correct network. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">However, you should </span><span class="wysiwyg-underline" style="color: #0e101a;">always double-check that the correct network is selected before withdrawing your crypto. The network selected on Kraken needs to match the one selected in the Ledger Live app.</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">A simple rule of thumb is to </span><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">always select the coin's native network</span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">. For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">BTC</span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;"> → Bitcoin network.</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">ETH</span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;"> → Ethereum network.</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">BNB</span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;"> → Binance Smart Chain network.</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">ETC</span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;"> → Ethereum Classic network.</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">DOT </span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">→ Polkadot network.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><span style="color: #0e101a;">Things, however, can get complicated. For example, with CRO—the native coin of the </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Crypto.org and Cronos chains—you </span><a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/6853158192157-How-to-manage-CRO-on-Ethereum-Crypto-org-and-Cronos?support=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">need to be extra careful</a><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">. </span>Or USDT (Tether) that can run across a variety of blockchains.</span></p>
<h2 id="h_01HDK9G4BYNYBFJNCQ6W6AYCW6"><span style="color: #434343;">Generate your Ledger deposit address</span></h2>
<div class="callout callout--warning">
<h4 id="h_01HDKACKDDC35DZP434PFXP87X" class="callout__title">
<em class="fa fa-magic"> </em>Don’t have an account yet?</h4>
<p><span style="color: #434343;"><span style="color: #0e101a;">If you follow the steps listed above, an account will be automatically created for you. Once that’s done you’ll land on the </span><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">Address</span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;"> page. </span></span></p>
</div>
<ol class="list-colored">
<li>Open the Ledger Live app.</li>
<li>Navigate to the left sidebar menu and click <strong>Receive</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the same crypto you selected on the exchange.</li>
<li>Select the same network you selected on Kraken. If the network isn't listed, then Ledger Live doesn't support it yet.</li>
<li>Connect and unlock your Ledger device. Your deposit address will be displayed.</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #0e101a;">QR code will appear. Click </span><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">Copy address</span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">.</span>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="h_01HDK9HMQ6ES87E4TBACM1TEZN"><span style="color: #434343;">Verify your deposit address</span></h2>
<div class="callout callout--primary">
<p><span style="color: #434343;">Ledger Live app can provide deposit addresses without a Ledger device. These addresses, however, are unverified and may not be secure. If you choose to use unverified addresses, you do so at your own risk.</span></p>
</div>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><em class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"> </em>Trust your device</span>: only trust the display of your Ledger device. <span style="color: #0e101a;">Now it’s time to verify that your deposit address is correct and matches the one displayed on your device.</span></p>
<p>Compare the address you copied from the Ledger Live app with the one displayed on your Ledger device. Does your Ledger device display the same deposit address as the Ledger Live app? <span style="color: #434343;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"></span></span></p>
<p>Now that you've verified the address, paste it into the Kraken <strong>To</strong> field and confirm that it matches the one in Ledger Live. <span style="color: #434343;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">All set.</span></p>
<h2 id="h_01HDK9KBWPPFAZ2T8Q3K3WSA9W"><span style="color: #434343;">Finalize withdrawal</span></h2>

<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><em class="fa fa-lightbulb"> </em>Pro tip</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">:</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Send a small amount first and verify that the transaction was received before sending larger amounts. </span></p>
</div>
<ol class="list-colored">
<li>Paste your Ledger deposit address into the withdrawal address box. Ensure that the address you pasted is the same as the one that was displayed on your Ledger device. </li>
<li>Enter the amount you want to withdraw. </li>
<li>Click <strong>Withdraw</strong>.</li>
<li>If you have two-factor authentication enabled on your Kraken account, you will be requested to enter a code from your authentication app before the transaction can be processed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Wait until the transaction is processed. Blockchain networks take different amounts of time to process transactions.<span style="color: #434343;"></span></p>
<p>You’ve taken control of your private keys and your crypto. Welcome to the world of self-custody.</p></body></html>
