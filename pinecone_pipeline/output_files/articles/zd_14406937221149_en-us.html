<p><span>This issue is intermittent and predominantly caused by significant stress on our Bitcoin infrastructure, and it's more likely to occur during periods of high activity on the Bitcoin (BTC) network.</span></p>
<h2 id="h_01HDNF9WVT2KZCG937SXD5JEEQ">Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
<li><span>Start by <strong>clearing the cache</strong> in Ledger Live. Just go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Help</strong> &gt; <strong>Clear cache</strong>. This will refresh the network data.<br></span></li>
<li id="h_01HDNFA35S6EDXXGZ7NJHNA010">
<span>If your transaction is not time-sensitive,</span>Â consider waiting for the activity on the Bitcoin network to subside before attempting your transaction again. The network activity can be monitored at <a href="https://mempool.space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://mempool.space</a>.</li>
