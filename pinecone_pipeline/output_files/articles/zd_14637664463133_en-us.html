<p>This article describes how to stake your ETH via Kiln's pool-staking feature available in the Kiln dashboard through Ledger Live.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HEJHDABEWY2FWNZA2TMAZ7FY">What is Kiln pooled-staking?</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Kiln is a protocol staking platform that allows you to lock your ETH coins to fund an Ethereum validator and get ETH rewards in return.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;"> <span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> <font color="#0e101a"> Unlike solo staking, which requires a minimum of 32 ETH, pooled staking lets you start with as little as 0.05 ETH. Your ETH funds will be pooled with others to reach the 32 ETH threshold necessary to fund an Ethereum validator and start getting rewards. </font> </span> </span></p>
<p><em class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"> </em> Please note that for legal reasons, <strong>US-based users cannot use the pooled staking service</strong> through Ledger Live.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HE3TMX3ZGFCEGG2YEQRH7KDD">Before you start</h2>

<ol class="list-colored">
<li><span>Open Ledger Live and navigate to the <strong>Discover</strong> section to find the <strong>Kiln dashboard.</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">In the dashboard, <span>ensure that the correct Ethereum account is selected before you proceed to select '<strong>Pooled staking.</strong>'</span><br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/14659403692317"><br><br></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Select the amount of ETH to stake, the minimum is 0.05 ETH. <span>After entering the desired ETH amount,</span> check the box to accept the terms and conditions and click on '<strong>Stake</strong>'.<br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/14659403695901"><br><br></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Ledger live will now prompt you to sign the staking transaction with your Ledger device. Click on '<strong>Continue'</strong>.<br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/14659620142749"><br><br></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span> This is when you'll need your Ledger device. Continue by opening the <strong>Kiln app</strong> on your device, and then carefully review the transaction details that appear on your device screen. <br><br>If everything checks out, you'll confirm the transaction directly on your Ledger device by navigating to the '<strong>Accept and send</strong>' option and pressing both buttons to sign.</span><br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/14659656741021"><br><br></span></li>
<li>
<span style="color: #0e101a;">Once the transaction has confirmed on the Ethereum network<span>, your staked ETH balance will be visible in the <strong>Rewards</strong> section of the Kiln dashboard.<br></span><br><br></span> <span style="color: #0e101a;"><span style="color: #0e101a;"> <font color="#0e101a"> <img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/14659949709725"> </font> <br><br><span style="color: #0e101a;">At the same time, your Ethereum account will receive <strong>Pooled Staked (psETH) tokens</strong> equivalent to the amount of ETH you staked. These tokens represent your share in the pool. They will show in your Ethereum account in Ledger Live but, unlike other ERC20 tokens, they are tied to your Ethereum account and <strong>cannot be</strong></span>  <font color="#0e101a"> <strong>transferred</strong>. </font> <br><br><font color="#0e101a"> <img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/14660086132765"> </font> <br><br><font color="#0e101a"> You're all set!

<div class="callout callout--primary">
<p><em class="fa fa-info-circle"> </em>Please note that it might take anywhere from <strong>a few hours to a few days</strong> before you start receiving ETH rewards, depending on the length of the activation queue which you can monitor at: <a href="https://www.validatorqueue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.validatorqueue.com/</a></p>

<h2 id="h_01HEMZ2NAH01W0PHYTTA86G828"><span style="color: #0e101a;">How to unstake ETH staked in a Kiln staking pool</span></h2>
<p><span>Unstaking ETH from a pool is straightforward and can be initiated whenever you choose. It involves a couple of transactions with your Ledger device: request an exit and withdrawing your ETH.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #0e101a;">Go back to the <strong>Rewards</strong> section of the Kiln dashboard, click on <strong>Request exit</strong> and confirm the transaction on your Ledger device.<br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/14660827991965"><br><br></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span>Once the Ethereum network confirms your transaction, your balance set to exit will appear on the dashboard, and you'll get a <strong>Kiln Exit Queue NFT</strong> in your Ethereum account. This NFT is essential for the final step of the unstaking process, which is withdrawing your staked ETH and rewards back to your Ethereum account.</span><br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/14660241551645"><br><br></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span>This final step can be taken after a waiting period of 1 to 4 days, once your exiting ETH balance is marked as <strong>Withdrawable</strong>. At that point, you'll redeem your Kiln Exit Queue NFT by confirming a withdrawal transaction with your Ledger device, completing the process and receiving your initial staked ETH along with any rewards.</span><br><br>You're all done!<br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/14660230940829"><br></span></li>
