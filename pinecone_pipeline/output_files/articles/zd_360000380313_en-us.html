<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can Ledger products help you manage crypto assets securely? What does it mean to own crypto assets?</span></p>
<h2>Take control of your private keys</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Owning crypto assets comes down to managing your </span><strong>private keys</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To first receive your assets, you request a transaction to a </span><strong>public address</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> created from your private key. To spend the crypto assets, you digitally </span><strong>sign a transaction</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> using your private key as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By using a service that holds your crypto assets, you are putting </span><strong>trust</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the service to keep the private keys </span><strong>secure from theft</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and to send your crypto assets </span><strong>when you request</strong> <strong>so</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As long as you’re not managing your own private keys, you don’t really own your crypto.</span></p>
<h2>Manage your private keys. Securely</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ledger hardware wallets enable easy and secure </span><strong>private key management</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When you </span><a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018784134-Set-up-as-new-device"><span style="font-weight: 400;">set up your device</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a unique set of</span><strong> private keys</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is created by Ledger’s secure </span><a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/security/the-secure-element-whistanding-security-attacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hardware</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.ledger.com/introducing-bolos-blockchain-open-ledger-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">software</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These private keys allow you to manage many</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accounts and crypto assets from a single device.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You transact by </span><a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020838914" target="_blank" rel="noopener">verifying and signing</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transactions on the device. To withdraw from an exchange, you </span><a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404389453841" target="_blank" rel="noopener">request</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your crypto assets to be sent to a public address provided by your hardware wallet. That’s how you become the </span><strong>legitimate owner</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of your crypto.</span></p>
<h2>Save the recovery phrase, it’s your only backup</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When </span><a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018784134-Set-up-as-new-device"><span style="font-weight: 400;">setting up</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your Ledger hardware wallet, it will provide a </span><strong>24-word recovery phrase</strong>, sometimes called (mnemonic) seed, <span style="font-weight: 400;">for</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">you</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to write down carefully. This is the </span><strong>only backup of your private keys</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It allows you to </span><a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404382560913" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restore</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your private keys if you lose access to your hardware wallet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must write down your 24-word recovery phrase precisely and in the correct order before </span><a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005514233" target="_blank" rel="noopener">storing it securely</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>Never enter your recovery phrase on<span> any other device</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Anyone who gets your recovery phrase can take your crypto assets. Ledger does not store your private keys, nor ever asks for it. </span></p>
