<p><em class="fa fa-info-circle"> </em>Here's a <strong>list of tips</strong> to help you custody your recovery phrase securely:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li>Ensure that your 24-word recovery phrase is <strong>obtained from your Ledger device's screen during the </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqmyNmjMmME&amp;list=PL6VM0N695IhkAgXKcBZpnwqLn4wh9vYYz&amp;index=1&amp;t=7s" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>initial setup</strong>.</a> Your recovery words do <span class="wysiwyg-underline">not</span> come in the box. The set of <strong>recovery sheets</strong> included in the box should be <strong>blank</strong>.</li>
<li>Do <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>not</strong></span> make a digital copy of your recovery phrase. <strong>Do not take a picture</strong> of your phrase. <strong>Do not save your phrase into a password manager</strong>. Your recovery phrase needs to stay strictly <strong>offline</strong>.</li>
<li>When first writing down your recovery phrase, make sure to <strong>number each word correctly</strong>. Use a ballpen and not a pencil. Use capital letters, they are easier to read. Make sure each recovery word is correctly spelled by using the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt" target="_self">BIP-39 list</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Always keep a physical copy of your recovery phrase</strong>. Memorizing your recovery phrase is <strong>not</strong> a safe strategy for long-term cold storage</li>
<li>Consider backing up your recovery phrase with a <a href="https://shop.ledger.com/products/cryptosteel-capsule-solo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crypto Steel Capsule Solo</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Do not scramble</strong> your recovery words.</li>
<li>Do <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>not</strong></span> seed your Ledger 24-word recovery phrase into Metamask. This would compromise your phrase.</li>
<li>Do <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>not</strong></span> seed your Metamask <strong>12-word</strong> recovery phrase into your Ledger device. Your Metamask recovery phrase was generated online. As such, <strong>it is not secure</strong>. Seeding it into your Ledger device would compromise all the Ledger accounts that are derived from that recovery phrase.</li>
<li><span>Be cautious of scams falsely promoted as Ledger endorsements. Ledger <strong>never supports airdrops</strong> which can be covers for scams aiming at tricking you into revealing your recovery phrase. If an offer seems too good to be true, it likely is</span></li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to protect your PIN code?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like your recovery phrase, your PIN code must be chosen during the device's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqmyNmjMmME&amp;list=PL6VM0N695IhkAgXKcBZpnwqLn4wh9vYYz&amp;index=1&amp;t=7s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initial setup</a>. A <strong>strong PIN is key</strong> to the security of your Ledger accounts.</span></p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li>
<strong>Always choose your PIN code yourself. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never use a PIN code you did not choose yourself.</span>
</li>
<li>Always enter your PIN code out of sight and away from prying eyes.</li>
<li>Do <strong>not</strong> store your PIN code on your computer or phone.</li>
<li>Change your PIN code if you believe it's been compromised. <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003357833" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more.</a>

<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">An <strong>8-digit</strong> PIN is <strong>more secure</strong> than a 4-digit PIN.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Choose a PIN that's hard to guess</strong>. Easy-to-guess PIN codes like 0000, 12345678, or 55555555 are <strong>not secure</strong>.</span></li>
<li>Do <strong>not</strong> choose your date of birth as a PIN code.</li>
