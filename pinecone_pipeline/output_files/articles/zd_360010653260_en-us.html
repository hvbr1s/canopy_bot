<h4 id="h_01HE0DWQ2PZ2TFV37FYCZBP1PT" class="callout__title"><strong>Ongoing issue with delegating and undelegating XTZ</strong></h4>
<p>We’ve identified a problem where delegation or undelegation of Tezos (XTZ) coins in Ledger Live may not be successfully broadcasted to the Tezos network. As a result, your transaction might hang indefinitely on the block explorer. We are aware of this issue, and our team is actively working on a resolution. A fix will be implemented in an upcoming version of Ledger Live.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can manage your XTZ stakes normally through <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/12436053094813-How-to-connect-to-Ledger-Tezos-account-using-Galleon-Wallet?support=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galleon</a> with your Ledger device.</p>

<em class="fa fa-info-circle"> </em> What happens to staking rewards when changing validator?</h4>
<p>When changing validator, there should normally not be a loss of staking rewards, if the validators both payout normally. Let's imagine changing from validator A to validator B. An initial waiting period of about 40 days starts until validator B should start paying rewards. During this time, validator A should continue paying rewards because validator A started paying rewards with an initial delay of about 40 days too.</p>

<div class="accordion__item-title">Delegation and reveal operations</div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<h3 id="h_01HAS5VN6DV63ACF27B2FBVXYQ">Reveal</h3>
<p><strong>The reveal operation</strong> makes the public address of a new Tezos account known to the Tezos network. This operation is required before any other transaction is possible and costs 0.0025 XTZ. Ledger Live automatically creates the reveal operation when you first send or delegate from an account.<br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/360007114899" alt="revealed.png"></p>
<h3 id="h_01HAS5VN6DEMW95DN62YR5WY5Q">Delegation</h3>
<p><strong>The delegation</strong> grants an account's voting rights to a third-party validator, also known as a delegate. The voting rights increase the probability that a validator can make new blocks. Validators bake new blocks and endorses blocks as part of its operations and earns rewards by doing so.<br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/360007098700" alt="delegated.png"></p>
<h3 id="h_01HAS5VN6D1D9JP7N0V8PXD6KS">Undelegation</h3>
<p><strong>The undelegation</strong> returns the voting rights to the account itself. This operation is similar to the delegation operation except that the <strong>To </strong>field is empty.<br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/360007019180" alt="undelegated.png"></p>

<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title">Sending and receiving with delegated accounts</div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p>Delegated accounts can send and receive normally like any other account.</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li>
<strong>Received coins</strong> are added to the account balance. Because the account is delegated, the additional coins are automatically being staked as long as the validator has sufficient delegation capacity.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sent coins</strong> are deducted from the account balance. The amount that has been sent is no longer being staked.</li>

<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p>If you've used <a href="https://cryptonomic.tech/galleon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galleon wallet</a> with your Ledger device, please note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ledger Live lists KT accounts as subaccounts. Ledger Live does not support sending to KT accounts, nor creating new KT accounts because of the Babylon Amendment. Sending from your KT accounts is supported.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to send to KT accounts, a third-party wallet needs to be used.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parent accounts (TZ addresses) pay for fees of subaccounts (KT addresses) and must therefore always have some remaining XTZ. If there is insufficient balance left to pay for subaccount transactions, please find another way to refill the parent account.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title">Sending to new accounts burns fees</div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sending XTZ to a new Tezos account will incur a cost of 0.257 XTZ in burnt fees for the account to be created. This is similar to the reveal operation, but the sender pays the fees.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title">Overdelegated validator</div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a validator is marked as <strong>overdelegated </strong>in Ledger Live, the reward payouts may be less than estimated. Each validator has a maximum delegation capacity, depending on the amount of XTZ the validator has put up as collateral. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At all times, it remains your responsibility as a delegator to regularly check the status and policy of your validator. Please check <a href="https://baking-bad.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baking Bad</a> for more information about validators.</span></p>
