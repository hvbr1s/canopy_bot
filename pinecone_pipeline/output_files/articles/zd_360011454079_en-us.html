<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ledger Live enables you to manage many different crypto assets using a single Ledger device</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Learn the difference between apps and accounts to manage your different coins easily.</span></p>
<h2>Apps manage different coins securely</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For each crypto asset that you want to manage, you need to <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404382258961" target="_blank" rel="noopener">install its app</a> on your Ledger hardware wallet. The app enables your Ledger hardware wallet to use its <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000380313" target="_blank" rel="noopener">private keys</a> for the specific blockchain network of the crypto asset. This lets you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404389453841" target="_blank" rel="noopener">receive</a> and <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404382228753" target="_blank" rel="noopener">send</a> that crypto asset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apps run fully isolated from each other thanks to the operating system on your Ledger device, <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/security/our-custom-operating-system-bolos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BOLOS</a>. This ensures that every app can only manage the crypto assets it is made for, providing an optimal level of security. </span></p>
<p><em class="fa fa-info-circle">  </em>Apps can be uninstalled safely whenever you want. Don't worry, this does not affect your crypto. </p>
<h2>Accounts are similar to bank accounts</h2>
<p>Accounts in Ledger Live have separated balances to provide flexibility in managing your crypto assets. You can add multiple accounts for each crypto asset and give them a name for different purposes (e.g. trading, checking, savings, etc.).</p>
<p>When you <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404389482641" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add an account</a>, Ledger Live gets its unique <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011069619" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extended public key</a> from your Ledger device. T<span>hanks to the xpub, Ledger Live then generates individual public addresses and checks their balances in the blockchain to calculate your account balance.</span></p></body></html>
