<p>Some crypto assets have migrated from a token to their own mainnet. Sending the mainnet version to your Ledger hardware wallet will result in a loss if the mainnet version is not supported.</p>
<h2>Investigate before you invest</h2>
<p>Do your own research before considering buying and managing any crypto asset. What kind of crypto asset is it? Is it a token? If yes, on which blockchain is the token issued? Is the token later supposed to migrate to its own native blockchain (mainnet)?</p>
<p>Find out which wallets support the token and mainnet versions of the crypto asset. Find out <a href="https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which crypto assets</a> are supported by Ledger.</p>
<p>If your Ledger device only supports the token version of a crypto asset, you cannot use it to manage the mainnet version. If you do proceed to send the mainnet version to your Ledger device, it will be lost.</p>
