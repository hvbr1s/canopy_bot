<h4 id="h_01HEQ46A0AT8AS4Y0WQS7MEECK">Does Bluetooth affect the security of Ledger Nano X?</h4>
<p>The private keys never leave the secure chip, therefore Bluetooth communication (BLE) does not expose the Ledger Nano X to any additional security threat. The BLE connection is end-to-end encrypted to protect user privacy. In the unlikely case, the BLE transport was to be compromised, an attacker would never be able to extract private keys or make users sign a transaction they do not wish to sign.
