<p>Our clients are regularly victims of phishing attempts by scammers. In recent days, particularly aggressive phishing campaigns have taken place (through social media, emailing and text messaging). This is why we would like to reiterate the importance for our customers to keep their recovery phrase safe and not to communicate it to anyone. </p>
<p>We recommend our clients to exercise caution — always be mindful of phishing attempts by malicious scammers. To put it simply, they should never share their 24 words. Ledger will never ask them for the 24 words of their recovery phrase. If our clients receive a communication that looks like it came from Ledger asking for their 24 words, they should definitely consider it a phishing attempt. In any case, they should not hesitate to contact the Ledger Support team. </p>
