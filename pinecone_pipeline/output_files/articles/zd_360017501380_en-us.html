<em class="fa fa-lightbulb-o">  </em> Important: How to backup your passwords</h4>
<p>Since your passwords are deterministically generated from your 24-word recovery phrase and your password nicknames, you can still retrieve your passwords in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>In case of loss, theft, or destruction of your device, you can still restore your passwords as long as you have your 24-word recovery phrase and have a backup of your password nicknames and the type of characters associated with each one.</li>
<li>In the case of firmware or application updates, the list of password nicknames is not automatically restored. But if you have your 24-word recovery phrase and have a backup of your password nicknames, you can manually restore the password nicknames.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is highly recommended to save a backup of your nickname passwords. You should use this web application <a href="https://blog.ledger.com/passwords-backup/">Passwords Backup</a> to backup and/ or restore the list of password nicknames stored inside the Passwords app on your Ledger device. A best practice is to create a new backup every time you add a new password. The passwords generated by this app are very secure, but in exchange, this app requires to be managed carefully.</p>
<p>In case you want to restore from JSON file and you don't have it but you have the nicknames for the passwords, you can download an empty JSON file <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/4411745703057/backup.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the backups don’t contain any confidential data. To retrieve your passwords, an attacker would need your list of password nicknames, the associated types of characters, and your 24-word recovery phrase. In other words, these backup files don’t require to be hidden but you need to have them. </p>
