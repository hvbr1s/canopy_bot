<p>With the release of the Chrome 95 update and future releases, U2F API for interacting with the Ledger devices will be progressively deprecated.</p>
<p>The third-party wallets and decentralized applications that involve the connection of the Ledger device with the old standard will not be accessible when the full deprecation takes place, expected in February 2022 with the Chrome 98 release. <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/deps-rems-95/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more</a>.</p>
<p>Affected third-party wallets and decentralized applications will have to migrate to the new standards. Popular wallets like Metamask, Yoroi, MyEtherWallet, and others already put in place <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebHID_API" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WebHID</a> and/or <a href="https://wicg.github.io/webusb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WebUSB</a> connection methods that will replace the deprecated U2F in the future.</p>
<p>If you will face a U2F error while connecting to a third-party wallet, that could be a result of this standard deprecation. In that case, <strong>reach out</strong> to wallet support with the error screenshot and explain the steps you took.</p>
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<p>While the developers of the third-party wallets or of decentralized applications will be adding the support of the new standards to their services, you can connect your Ledger device by using alternative solutions.</p>

<div class="accordion__item-title">Switching connection method</div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p>Some wallets may offer to users manually choose amongst the connection options. For example, a third-party wallet <a href="https://adalite.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adalite</a> for Cardano (ADA) has an option to choose between U2F (which is going to be deprecated soon), WebUSB, and WebHID. In this case, <strong>the most stable method</strong> to connect your Ledger device will be <strong>WebHID</strong>. </p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">If you encounter a U2F error during the connection to the third-party wallet, check in the wallet settings if the wallet provides an option to switch between different connection methods and choose WebHID as the most preferable option. </p>
