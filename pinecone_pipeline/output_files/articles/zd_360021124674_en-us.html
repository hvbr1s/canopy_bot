<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you’ve seen the markets and decided to use your Ledger device after a while? To quickly get you up to speed, please have a look at the latest changes below.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Update to the very latest version of Ledger Live</span></h2>
<p>We publish new versions of Ledger Live very frequently (every 2 weeks to a month). This is meant not only to provide additional features, but also to fix potential bugs and more importantly to update key parameters allowing to synchronize your accounts and portfolio to the different blockchains.</p>
<p>To be sure all of your transactions will be showing in your wallet, you can either update Ledger Live directly from the app itself (orange notification showing at the top) or by downloading it <a href="https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Update the firmware for optimal security</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The functionality and security of Ledger devices are continuously improved with new firmware versions. You can update your Ledger device using My Ledger in Ledger Live. Please use our firmware update guide for <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002731113" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ledger Nano S</a>, <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4445777839901" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nano S Plus</a>, and <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013349800" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nano X </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">during the update. Our </span><a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003117594" target="_blank" rel="noopener">troubleshooting article</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is useful in case you get stuck. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Install apps and add accounts</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The apps for your Ledger device are available to </span><a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404382258961" target="_blank" rel="noopener">install and uninstall in "My Ledger"</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Ledger Live. After installing an app, you can </span><a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404389482641" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add your accounts</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the crypto assets supported in Ledger Live. You can check which crypto assets are supported in our </span><a href="https://shop.ledger.com/pages/supported-crypto-assets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of supported crypto assets</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides crypto assets added by Ledger, there are crypto assets developed and supported by third parties. You cannot (yet) add accounts for these in Ledger Live, so you must use third-party (web) apps for them. The </span><a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/sections/4404369637521-Crypto-assets?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto assets section in our support center</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides information on how to manage any crypto asset supported on your Ledger device.</span></p></body></html>
