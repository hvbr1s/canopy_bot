<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case of damage, loss, or theft of your Ledger wallet device, you can get back access to your accounts thanks to your 24-word recovery phrase by <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404382560913-Restore-from-recovery-phrase?support=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restoring</a> it on a new Ledger device. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have lost your device, rest assured, your PIN code should prevent any thief to steal your crypto assets. Indeed, after three incorrect PIN codes, your lost Ledger device will get reset to its factory settings, erasing the 24-word recovery phrase it holds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that your 24-word recovery phrase is what is stored on your Ledger device and grants access to your funds.</span><a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005514233-Secure-your-PIN-recovery-phrase"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">You must never reveal it and never lose it.</span></a></p>
