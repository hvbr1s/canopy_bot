These keys are securely held in your Ledger device and are linked to a unique 24-word recovery phrase created when you first set up your device. If your Ledger device doesn't contain the specific private keys that correspond to the account you wish to spend from, the transaction will fail, and Ledger Live will display the following error:</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is my Ledger device defective? Could this be an issue with the Ledge Live app?</span></h2>
<p><span>No, this issue isn’t a result of a faulty device or a malfunctioning Ledger Live app. It distinctly indicates that your Ledger device contains a different set of private keys than those necessary to access your account, or it means that the device was restored using an incorrect recovery phrase.</span></p>
