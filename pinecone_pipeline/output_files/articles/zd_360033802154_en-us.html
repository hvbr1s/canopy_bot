<div class="mw-parser-output">
<p>Bitcoin (BTC) transactions often include <strong>two</strong> destination addresses: one for the recipient and another as a <strong>change address</strong> linked to your Ledger account. This system resembles cash transactions and stems from Bitcoin's use of <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/glossary/unspent-transaction-output-utxo#:~:text=An%20Unspent%20Transaction%20Output%20or,leftover%20cryptocurrency%20in%20a%20transaction." target="_self">UTXOs</a> to track your BTC balance.</p>
<p>This change-address system is also seen in blockchains similar to Bitcoin, which employ UTXO accounting, such as Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Avalanche X-Chain and Zcash (ZEC).</p>
<p><span>However, the change-address system does <strong>not</strong> apply to accounts like Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and many others. For instance, Ethereum (ETH) or XRP addresses are <strong>static</strong> and remain unchanged after each transaction.</span></p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>When a transaction<span> </span>does not entirely consume the coins it is spending, the difference is known as change. The change is sent back to an automatically generated address called the <strong>change address</strong>.</p>
<p>You can compare UTXO-based transactions with cash. Imagine you buy a hotdog that costs $5 with a $10 bill. In return, you will get a $5 bill of change. This change belongs to you and it will come back to your wallet. In that comparison, your wallet with $5 is a <strong>change address</strong>, still yours but a different bill. The same goes for BTC.</p>
<p>Example: </p>
<ol>
<li>John has 1 BTC and sends it to me. John has 0 BTC, and I now have 1 BTC.</li>
<li>I then send 0.2 BTC to my friend Suzy 
<ul>
<li>0.2 BTC goes to Suzy's account</li>
<li>0.8 BTC goes to <strong>my </strong>change address =&gt; my BTC account</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>My total account reflects the remaining 0.8 BTC</li>
</ol>

<ul class="list-bullet">
<li>Ledger Live automatically generates a fresh change address for every new transaction that does not fully spend its inputs.</li>
<li>Ledger Live automatically takes care of change, you do not have to track the coins on your change addresses.</li>
<li>It is not possible to check which address is your change address in Ledger Live. You can check your Bitcoin change addresses using <a title="Apps:Electrum" href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005161925" target="_self">Electrum</a>.</li>

<p>Always verify receiving addresses on your Ledger device and send a small amount first before sending larger amounts. Never assume that an address shown in the transaction details is yours!</p>

<h2>Change addresses in Ledger Live</h2>
<p>It is not only Bitcoin that uses the change addresses model in Ledger Live but other crypto-assets apply the same UTXO model too:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin</li>
<li>All Bitcoin-similar crypto-assets
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin Cash</li>
<li>Bitcoin SV</li>
<li>Litecoin</li>
<li>Dogecoin</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Zcash</li>
<li>Dash</li>
<li>Cardano</li>
<li>Qtum</li>
<li>Other assets that use <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011069619-Extended-public-key-xPub-?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xpub</a> (extended public key) and generate different receiving addresses</li>
</ul></body></html>
