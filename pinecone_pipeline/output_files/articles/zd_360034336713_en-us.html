<div class="article-body markdown">
<p><span>Your address for Bitcoin and Bitcoin-based crypto assets changes every time you <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404389453841" target="_blank" rel="noopener">receive</a> a transaction. For other crypto assets (Ethereum, XRP, Stellar, etc.) the address stays the same.</span></p>
<p>Bitcoin transactions are public information. Addresses should not be re-used for better privacy. Ledger Live automatically generates new addresses using standards<span> (<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BIP32</a>/<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BIP39</a>/<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BIP44</a>)</span> and keeps track of your previous ones. Previous addresses do remain valid, but they don't offer an optimal level of privacy.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Bitcoin, </span>Cardano is an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO)-based blockchain<span style="font-weight: 400;">. This means that once you receive ADA to a Cardano address, the next generated receiving address will be different from the previous one. <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033802154-Change-addresses-for-UTXO-based-crypto-assets?support=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more about UTXOs</a>.</span></p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Each of your crypto assets accounts has an <em>extended public key</em>, called an <strong>xpub</strong>. From this extended public key all your public addresses for that account are generated. Thanks to the xpub you can receive transactions on a new address that belong to the same account.</p>
<p>You can find the xpub of an account in Ledger Live by clicking the wrench icon on the account page. In the <strong>Edit account</strong> window, check the <strong>advanced logs</strong>.  </p>
