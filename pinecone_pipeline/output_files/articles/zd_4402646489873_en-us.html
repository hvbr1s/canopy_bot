<p>When withdrawing crypto assets from Binance, you will be offered a number of different network options.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/4406114189713" alt="1.PNG"></p>
<p>A simple rule of thumb is to <strong>always select the coin's native network</strong>. For example:<strong><br></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>BTC</strong> should be sent to your Ledger Bitcoin address via the BTC/Bitcoin network.</li>
<li>
<strong>ETH</strong> and <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto/what-are-erc20-tokens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ERC20 tokens</a> should be sent to your Ledger Ethereum address via the ETH/ERC20 network.</li>
<li>
<strong>BNB</strong> and <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/bep-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BEP20 tokens</a>Â  should be sent to your Ledger Binance Smart Chain address via the BNB/BEP20 network.</li>
<li>
<strong>ETC</strong> should be sent to your Ledger Ethereum Classic address via the ETC network.</li>
<li>
<strong>DOT </strong>should be sent to your Ledger Polkadot address via the DOT network.</li>
</ul>
<p>For most withdrawals, Binance automatically matches the target address to the correct network but <strong>make sure to always double-check that the correct network is selected</strong> before sending your coins to your Ledger wallet.</p>
