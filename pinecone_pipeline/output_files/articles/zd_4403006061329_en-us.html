<p>Yes, by default both the standard and express delivery methods will require you to sign a receipt when the product is delivered to your door.</p>
<h3>What if I do not wish to sign a receipt?</h3>
<p>You can contact the carrier to cancel a signature required.</p>
<p>In this case, <strong>please note that carriers wonâ€™t accept claims in the event of the product being delivered to the wrong person/address or left at your door.</strong></p></body></html>
