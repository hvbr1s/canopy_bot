<p>We are aware of a bug in Ledger Live desktop version 2.71.0 that currently prevents users from swapping more than 1000 units of any cryptocurrency. This issue results in a '<strong>Something went wrong</strong>' error and blocks the swap. Our team is working on a solution. <span>In the meantime, you have three options:  </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>You can swap using <strong>Ledger Live mobile.</strong></span></li>
<li>
<span>You can revert to Ledger Live desktop version <strong>2.69.0</strong>,  by visiting </span><a href="https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/lld-signatures" target="_new">https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/lld-signatures</a>
</li>
<li>
<span>If you prefer to remain on the latest desktop version, consider using alternative swapping services </span> like <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020761557-Paraswap-?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paraswap</a> or <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/6490128879389-1inch?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1inch</a> that are available in the <strong>Discover</strong> section in Ledger Live.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h_01HBFVYGX5PE3VBR9SMBS6W7FD"><span style="font-weight: 400;">KYC verification</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changelly is a regulated third-party swapping service. As such,  Changelly <strong>might put your transaction on hold</strong> and request you to<strong> pass a KYC check</strong>. In that case, you need to contact </span><a href="mailto:security@changelly.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security@changelly.com</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. After that, you’ll receive a link to complete the verification process. Please note that your funds might be held until the KYC check is completed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some documents you may need:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<strong>Your ID</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Changelly will request you to send a high-quality photo of your personal identity document, such as a passport. This document has to be valid in your country.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<strong>A picture of you holding your ID</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You’ll have to take a picture or a video of your face next to the ID you’re sending. </span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<strong>Proof of source of funds</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is required to prove the origin of your funds. In this case, you'll have to explain how you obtained them and attach corresponding documents or screenshots. </span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<strong>Liveness check</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. An instant facial verification done via the camera of your device.</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please keep in mind that there are some cases where your KYC submission can be rejected. If this happens, the Changelly security team will contact you to resolve the issue. </span></p>
<h3 id="h_01HBFVYGX5Q9MPS65ARREKHXZQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How long will my transaction be on hold?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes it can take several weeks or even months to process a transaction. This is usually because several different stakeholders are involved. The majority of transactions, however, are processed quickly.</span></p>
<p><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information, please read Changelly’s guide on </span><a href="https://changelly.com/blog/why-pass-kyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KYC verification</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
