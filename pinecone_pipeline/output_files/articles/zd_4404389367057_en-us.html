<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Ledger products are built around a combination of hardware and software security, meant to protect your private keys from a wide range of potential attacks. Use this guide to make sure your Ledger device is genuine, and not fraudulent or counterfeit.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><iframe src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zSTdgUb25ZQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A few simple checks will assure you that your device is a genuine Ledger product:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li>Origin of the Ledger product</li>
<li>Box contents</li>
<li>Condition of the Recovery sheet</li>
<li>Initial state of the Ledger device.</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p><em class="fa fa-info-circle"> </em> Since Ledger devices are manufactured in different periods of time, some characteristics such as the packaging and the color of internal components can present some slight differences. Don’t worry, this has no impact on the functionality of your device and your device is safe to use.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HA4D4KQCXY1R9CXYHFYQPYY4">Buy from an official Ledger reseller</h2>
<p>Purchase your device directly from Ledger or through the <a href="https://www.ledger.com/pages/retailers">authorized distributor / reseller network</a> to make sure you receive an authentic Ledger product. Our official sales channels include:</p>
