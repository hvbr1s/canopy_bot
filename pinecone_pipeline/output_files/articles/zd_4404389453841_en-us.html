<p>You can receive crypto assets on accounts managed by your Ledger device by generating a receive address in the Ledger Live app. Assets not supported by Ledger Live can be managed through an <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026472413" target="_blank" rel="noopener">external wallet</a>.</p>

<h4 id="h_01HA51GDJEYH33JB60BEYZFE03" class="callout__title"><strong>Why is the BTC receiving address changing every time?</strong></h4>
<p>Blockchains based on Bitcoin are public networks. For optimal privacy, the addresses of those crypto assets should generally not be re-used after a transaction. For other crypto assets (Ethereum, XRP, Stellar, etc.) the address stays the same.</p>
<p>Ledger Live generates new addresses for crypto assets based on Bitcoin. The previous addresses do remain valid, but they don't offer an optimal level of privacy. <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034336713-Receiving-address-changed?support=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more</a></p>
<strong>Can I store traditional fiat currency in my Ledger wallet?</strong>
<p><span>Ledger wallets are designed to securely store cryptocurrencies that exist on various blockchain networks. However, these blockchains are not directly compatible with traditional financial systems, which operate on separate networks and rails. As a result, you can't store traditional fiat currencies like USD or EUR directly in your Ledger wallet. </span></p>
<p><span>You can, however, store stablecoins like USDT, USDC or DAI, which are blockchain-based equivalents of fiat currencies. To learn how to manage stablecoins, follow <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/8950985607325-How-to-manage-stablecoins-USDC-DAI-USDT-with-Ledger-Live?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these steps</a>.</span></p>
