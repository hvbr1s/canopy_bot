<p>In one sentence, they are just as safe as if you were managing your coins directly on Ledger Live. In both cases, your private keys never leave your Ledger device. Follow the steps outlined below to start managing ADA with a third-party wallet. </p>
<h2>Installing the Cardano app </h2>

<li>Connect and unlock your Ledger device.</li>
<li>If asked, allow My Ledger to access your device.</li>
<li>Find <strong>Cardano </strong>in the app catalog.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Install</strong> button of the app.
<ul>
