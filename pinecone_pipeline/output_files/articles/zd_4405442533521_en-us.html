<p>This article will provide tips to help you after a failed <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007223753" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recovery check</a>.</p>
<h2>Run the check again</h2>
<ul>
<li>Typing recovery words into a Ledger device can be a tricky task. <strong>Multiple attempts might be required</strong> before your phrase is correctly typed in and passes the check successfully.</li>
<li>Don't worry, recovery checks can be safely attempted an infinite number of times. <strong>Failing a recovery check will not lock your accounts, reset your Ledger device or compromise your coins</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Double-check your recovery phrase</h2>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li>Make sure that all the words on your recovery sheet are on the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/3b0662a6227aaf510da791a8e9dcd4f875ebe57f/bip-0039/english.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BIP39 word list</a> and are <strong>correctly spelled</strong>.</li>
<li>Make sure to select the correct recovery phrase length on your Ledger device (12, 18, or 24 words). The selected length should match the length of your recovery phrase.<br>
