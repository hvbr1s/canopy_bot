<p>The applications on your Ledger device are automatically uninstalled as soon as the firmware update is downloaded onto your device. If you cancel the update, you will have to install your applications manually again. <strong>Don't worry</strong>, this does not affect your crypto assets as the private keys providing access to your crypto remain safe on your device.  </p></body></html>
