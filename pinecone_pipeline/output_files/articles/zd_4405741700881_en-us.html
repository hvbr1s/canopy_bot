<p>If you can't access your Ledger device and you still have your 24-word recovery phrase (which hasn't been lost, stolen, or given out), you can rest assured that your crypto assets remain safe. In such cases, you can restore your funds through your recovery phrase on <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/articles/4404388633489?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">any hardware or software wallet that supports 24-word recovery phrases</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HA5BMX0YRV1A0MQTAW7668BX">Self-Service USB Connection Issues</h2>
<p>Before attempting recovery through your recovery phrase, make sure to rule out any USB connection issues. Ensure that your Ledger device is correctly connected to your computer and that you are using a reliable USB cable. Sometimes, issues can be caused by a bad cable or interference on your computer.

<h2 id="h_01HA5BMX0YBZY60N1PH0PX01WS">Using Your Recovery Phrase with a Software Wallet</h2>
<p>You might be wondering, "How is it possible that I can use my recovery phrase with a software wallet? Isn't this my Ledger Recovery phrase?" The answer lies in the fact that recovery phrases are essentially generic, following the <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/articles/4415198323089-How-Ledger-device-generates-24-word-recovery-phrase?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BIP-39 standard</a>. <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/bip-39-the-low-key-guardian-of-your-crypto-freedom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This standard</a> ensures compatibility across various wallets, including hardware and software ones.

<h2 id="h_01HA5BMX0YVJX9Y0CT01GDFEQ7">The Risks of Restoring an Online Wallet with Your Recovery Phrase</h2>
<p>Restoring your wallet using your recovery phrase in an online environment poses certain risks. Your Ledger recovery phrase is highly secure because it remains offline, away from potential threats like malware and hacks. However, <strong>when you input your recovery phrase into an online wallet, you expose it to the digital world</strong>. This makes your recovery phrase vulnerable to potential security breaches.</p>
<p>It's crucial to understand the risks involved and take necessary precautions when restoring your wallet online. Always ensure you are using a reputable and secure software wallet, and be cautious when entering your recovery phrase on any online platform.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HA5BMX0YVRA90FQFQ3S5D5J7">Changing your recovery phrase and creating new accounts</h2>
<p>If you find yourself in a situation where you need immediate access to your funds, it's essential to take steps to secure your assets. One option is to transfer your funds to a temporary, outside account, reset your device, and create a fresh wallet with a 24-word secret recovery phrase. Then, you'd send the funds back to your new accounts in Ledger Live. This can be done by following the steps outlined in our guide on <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/articles/8460010791069-How-to-change-your-recovery-phrase-and-create-new-accounts?support=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to change your recovery phrase and create new accounts</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HA5BMX0YRV1A0MQTAW7668BX">Restoring with an existing secret recovery phrase</h2>
<p>Looking to recover your accounts but facing issues with your current Ledger device? If you are, you can restore access by setting up <a href="https://shop.ledger.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new Ledger Nano device</a> using your original recovery phrase. This way, your recovery phrase remains secure while you regain control of your funds.</p>
<p>Please remember to handle your recovery phrase with the highest level of caution and only use it when absolutely necessary. Prioritize the security of your cryptocurrency assets above all else.
