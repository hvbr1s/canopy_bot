<div class="accordion__item-title">Can I get my 10 XRP reserve back?</div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">Yes, it's possible to get some of that reserve back by <strong>deleting your XRP account</strong>. The cost of deleting an account <a href="https://xrpl.org/accounts.html#deletion-of-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is currently 2 XRP</a>. You can learn more about how to delete an XRP account <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407362579217?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</div>

<div class="accordion__item-title">Do I need a destination tag/ID to send XRP to my Ledger device?</div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">No, destination tags (sometimes called <strong>memo tags</strong> or <strong>memo IDs</strong>) are only needed to send funds from your Ledger XRP account to an exchange (like Binance or Coinbase) or to send XRP between two exchanges (for example: Binance to Coinbase). <strong>When sending XRP from an exchange to your Ledger device you can leave the memo field blank or type in any random string of characters (for example "1111")</strong>.</div>

<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title">Do I need a destination tag/ID to send XRP to an exchange?</div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">Yes, <strong>it's important to include a destination tag when sending XRP funds from your Ledger XRP account to an exchange account</strong>. Exchanges need tags to credit XRP deposits to the correct accounts. You can learn how to attach a destination tag to an XRP transaction <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005177349-XRP-XRP-?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</div>

<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title">I forgot to attach a destination tag to my transaction, what can I do?</div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">Don't worry, your funds are not lost and can be recovered by the exchange. <strong>Please reach out to the exchange's support team directly</strong>. In your email, make sure to include the <strong>transaction ID</strong> in plain text (no screenshots). Please note that some exchanges will charge you a small fee to recover your XRP.</div>

<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title">I just received a very small XRP transaction, what happened?</div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<span>This could be a <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-a-dusting-attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dusting attack</a>. </span><span>Despite its ominous name, a </span><strong>dusting attack is not a direct threat to your XRP funds </strong>but often <span>the work of a malicious third-party trying to spy on your account activity. </span><span>Since all blockchain accounts are </span><a href="https://stellarchain.io/" rel="noreferrer">public by </a><a href="https://xrpscan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nature</a>,<span> anyone can select a random sample of XRP addresses and send dust funds to them. </span><span>Dusting attacks are sometimes followed by phishing attacks or contain malicious links attached as memo. If you're the victim of a dusting attack, don't panic. <strong>Your funds are safe as long as your 24-word recovery phrase is not revealed</strong>. You can learn more about how to protect yourself against phishing attacks <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/somethings-phishy-how-to-keep-your-crypto-safe-against-scams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</span>

<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title">My transaction failed and returned a "<span>Ledger sequence too high</span>" and/or "<span>Network timed out</span>" error?</div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">The XRP network will <strong>automatically fail transactions that are not confirmed on your Ledger device within 48 seconds after they are broadcast</strong>. Don't worry, this doesn't affect your funds. Your XRP funds never left your Ledger account in the first place. Please send the transaction again and make sure to confirm it on your Ledger device within the imparted time.</div>
