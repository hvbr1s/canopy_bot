<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Dust?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the language of crypto, the term </span><strong>dust </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">refers to a very small amount of coins or tokens. If taking bitcoin as an example, the smallest unit of the BTC is 1 satoshi (0.00000001 BTC), so dust could be equal to a few hundred satoshis.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a Dusting attack?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><strong>dusting attack </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a new type of malicious activity performed by scammers when they send tiny amounts of coins or tokens (</span><strong>dust</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">) to thousands, sometimes even hundreds of thousands of addresses on the network. There are different reasons behind these attacks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main purpose of these attacks is to track the transactional data of the wallets sufficiently enough in order to deanonymize the owner of the wallet and perform a <strong>targeted</strong> <strong>phishing attack</strong> on the victim to get hold of users’ crypto.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phishing attack with dust transaction</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another strategy quite often confused with dusting attacks is sending a malicious link included in the </span><a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409603715217-What-is-a-Memo-Tag-?support=true"><span style="font-weight: 400;">memo tag</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the dust transaction. In fact, this one is a </span><strong>phishing attack with dust payment </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">and should not be confused with a dusting attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This strategy is common for coins that support tag feature, for example, Stellar (XLM) and XRP (XRP). The message included in the memo tag could look like “airdrop invite xlmfree.org”. A user who once followed the link might be scammed either by sending his assets to the unknown address or by sharing his 24-word recovery phrase. It is not recommended to interact in any way with the links included in memo tags for the safety of the funds.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do scammers know my wallet’s address? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the transactional information on most blockchains is public and available in all chain explorers, there is no difficulty for the scammers to see the transactions on the network. Though they still can see various addresses and amounts of coins sent, they have no information whatsoever about the identity of the address owners.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should I be worried about receiving dusting transactions?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dust assets on your wallet don’t give anyone control of your funds. If you encounter a </span><strong>dusting attack, </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">simply ignore it and try not to interact with the “dust”. For coins like Bitcoin and BTC-like, you can use a </span><a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015996580-Using-Coin-control?docs=true"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coin Control</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> feature in Ledger Live in order to avoid transferring these tiny amounts of coins you received. Another good practice is to use each time different receiving addresses for coins like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Doge, and for all with the same concept of </span><a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033802154-Change-addresses?support=true"><span style="font-weight: 400;">changing addresses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For</span><strong> phishing attacks with dusting payments</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that contain a message in memo tag, simply ignore them and do not follow the links whatever they promise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it is not possible to avoid dusting transactions on public blockchains, you can remain safe by being careful and taking all the precautions.</span></p></body></html>
