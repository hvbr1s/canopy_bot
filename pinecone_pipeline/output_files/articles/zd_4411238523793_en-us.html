<p>This article will help you identify and troubleshoot an issue where Ledger Live <strong>stops processing a "send" transaction</strong> and <strong>stalls at step 4 of the sending process</strong>.</p>
<h2>What is this error?</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Ledger Live <strong>never completes a transaction sent from a Ledger account</strong>. Instead, the transaction <strong>stalls on Step 4 (Device)</strong> and Ledger Live displays a <strong>loading wheel that never stops spinning:</strong><br><br></p>

<p>This error <strong>typically affects</strong> <a href="https://river.com/learn/bitcoins-utxo-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UTXO-based</a> cryptocurrencies such as<strong> Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Zcash (ZEC), Digibyte (DGB)</strong>, etc.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">The error <strong>might</strong> be preceded by a <strong>"This transaction may take too long to verify..." </strong>warning which is displayed on <strong>Step 3 (Summary)</strong> of the <strong>Send</strong> process:<br><br></p>

<h2>Why am I getting this error?</h2>
<p>This error happens because the Ledger account you're trying to spend from contains <strong>too many coin fragments</strong> (also called Unspent Transaction Outputs or <strong>UTXOs</strong> for short).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UTXOs are created by </span><strong>transactions</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Each </span><strong>deposit </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">transaction into a Bitcoin/Litecoin/Zcash account will result in </span><strong>a single new UTXO</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> being created and locked into that account. It’s important to note that the value of the deposit does not affect the number of UTXOs created. One deposit transaction to your account </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">always</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> results in </span><strong>a single UTXO being created</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, however,<strong> a single Ledger account can accumulate a very large number of UTXOs</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is </span><strong>usually not an issue</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because Ledger accounts can lock an unlimited number of UTXOs. However, in extreme cases, the number of UTXOs locked into an account is so large that </span><strong>a Ledger device won't be able to read all the UTXOs necessary to assemble a transaction</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This will result in the transaction stalling in Ledger Live.</span></p>
<p>This issue <strong>typically affects cryptocurrency miners</strong> receiving frequent mining rewards directly into a Ledger account. Mining tends to <strong>create very large numbers of UTXOs</strong> which can result in the issue described above. This is why we <strong>strongly advise against receiving mining rewards directly into a Ledger account</strong>.

<h2>What can I do to solve this issue?</h2>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Try sending a smaller amount of coins. Ideally, you want to</span><strong> break the transaction into smaller transactions </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">that your device can more easily manage.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the </span><strong>Coin control</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> feature in Ledger Live. Coin control gives you more flexibility by </span><strong>letting you choose which specific UTXOs you want to include in your transaction</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You can learn more about using Coin control</span><a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015996580-Using-Coin-control?docs=true"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><br><em class="fa fa-info-circle"> </em>Similarly, try breaking down your transaction into smaller chunks that include 1 or 2 UTXOs.</li>
