<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In order to use an OTG cable to connect your Ledger device to an Android phone, you may need to enable OTG connection in your phone's settings. To do this, head over to your Android settings and look for the "OTG" or "USB OTG" option. Once you've found it, simply enable it.<br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/9758956637597" alt="NUoIosyDM.jpeg" width="262" height="583"><br><br></p>
<p>It's important to note that if you don't use the OTG connection within about 10 minutes of enabling it, some Android phones may disable this feature automatically. To avoid this, we recommend connecting your Ledger device to your phone as soon as possible after enabling the OTG connection.</p></body></html>
