<p><strong><em class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"> </em>No</strong>, it's <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>not safe</strong></span> to restore (or import)  your Metamask 12-word secret recovery phrase into your Ledger device.</p>

<p>Unlike a Ledger wallet which is a hardware wallet, Metamask is a <strong>software wallet</strong>. Software wallets have <strong>multiple flaws</strong> that make them <strong>unsafe to use for long term storage</strong> of crypto funds:</p>
<ul>
<li>they are connected to the internet most of the time.</li>
<li>they display your recovery phrase on your computer or phone screen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Malware</strong> infecting your phone or computer could <strong>easily spy</strong> on software wallets to <strong>log your keys</strong> or <strong>extract your recovery phrase</strong>. You can learn more <a href="https://donjon.ledger.com/software-wallets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a><br><br>Seeding your Metamask recovery phrase into your Ledger device <strong>defeats the purpose of using a Ledger wallet </strong>because the security of your funds now hinges on a recovery phrase that <strong>may have been compromised</strong> from the moment it was created by your Metamask wallet.</p>
<p>A cunning hacker could obtain your Metamask recovery phrase and then sit on it for months before launching an attack that sweeps your Ledger accounts.</p>
<p>As a result, the only way to create a safe recovery phrase is to <strong>generate it completely offline</strong>. This is what your Ledger device does <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqmyNmjMmME&amp;list=PL6VM0N695IhkAgXKcBZpnwqLn4wh9vYYz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during the initial setup</a>. Your Ledger 24-word phrase is safe from hackers because <strong>it doesn't have a digital copy</strong>. Therefore, your Ledger device should only be seeded with a recovery phrase that's been <strong>generated by a Ledger device</strong> or by another <strong>hardware</strong> wallet.</p>
