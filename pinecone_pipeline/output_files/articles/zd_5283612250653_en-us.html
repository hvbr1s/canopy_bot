<div class="accordion accordion--default">
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Do I need a Ledger wallet and/or Ledger Live to get or use the CL Card?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">You don’t need a Ledger wallet and/or Ledger Live to get or use the CL Card. However, if you want to enhance the security of your CL Card user experience, we highly recommend using your CL Card with your Ledger wallet. By combining your Ledger wallet with the Ledger Live app, you can seamlessly and securely move your assets between your Ledger wallet and the CL Card, taking advantage of Ledger’s unique digital security ecosystem.</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>What does Powered by Ledger stand for?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CL Card is operated by Baanx.* Powered by Ledger stands next to its name because the card is fully integrated with Ledger’s ecosystem. You can create a CL account in Ledger Live and move assets seamlessly and securely between your Ledger wallet and the card.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Can I use my crypto as collateral?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, you can use Cryptodraft or Stableloan and open a line of credit to spend on your card.**** </span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Can I earn cashback with my CL Card?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every time you spend with your CL Card, you get rewards.****</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To enable rewards, you first need to select the crypto you want to receive cashback in—currently available in BTC, USDT, and BXX. The reward amount will be calculated based on all the transactions you've made with your card throughout the month. At the end of each month, you will receive a 1% reward for the total amount of card transactions (BTC, USDT) or a 2% reward if you choose BXX.</span></p>

<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Is the crypto-to-fiat conversion carried out directly from my Ledger wallet?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, you need to fund your CL Card before you start spending. You can fund the card with the crypto you have in your Ledger Live wallet. Crypto-to-fiat conversion will take place at the time of purchase.***</span></p>
