<p>This article covers the most frequent reason when you aren't able to see your USDT deposit in your Tron (TRX) account in Ledger Live.</p>
<p><span>USDT is the TRC20 USD-pegged stablecoin issued by Tether on the TRON network. In order to receive TRC20 tokens, you have to use your Tron receiving address from Ledger Live. <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013062159-Manage-TRC10-and-TRC20-tokens?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more</a>.</span></p>
<h3><span>I sent my USDT to Ledger Tron address and still can't see it in Ledger Live</span></h3>
<p><span>For the newly created accounts on Tron, you need first to activate them in order to see your USDT or any other TRC10 / TRC20 tokens.</span></p>
<p><span>The <strong>minimum required amount</strong> for the account to be activated is <strong>0.1 TRX. </strong><a href="https://developers.tron.network/docs/account" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more.</a></span></p>
<p><span>So if you did send USDT to Ledger Tron account and if they are not visible, please make sure you have <strong>at least 0.1 TRX</strong> on the main Tron account where you sent USDT. Only then your USDT will appear in the Tron parent account.</span></p>
