<h2 id="h_01HASDBZ08255S89459RGAQ1AZ">Why am I not seeing rewards?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to understand that staking DOT on a chain is an active process that requires periodic attention to ensure reward accrual will continue. There can be numerous factors that can influence the receipt of staking rewards through Ledger Live:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting in February 2022, the DOT community updated the network and the minimum bond amount to 10 DOT.  Even if users bond, there is no guarantee of rewards. Not all nomination intentions will be consistently elected to receive rewards. As a result, users might receive staking rewards less frequently than before the update.</span></li>
<li>
<span>Users can nominate starting from 10 DOT, but rewards will only be received once the <strong>minimum nomination amount of DOT is reached</strong>. This amount is subject to change based on network parameters. As of November, 2023, the minimum DOT amount for nomination eligibility is <strong>502 DOTs</strong>. To check the current amount, </span>go <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;" href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/staking/targets"><span>here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>

<p>If you hold fewer DOTs than the minimum nomination amount required for staking, consider joining a <strong>nomination pool</strong> instead. With as little as 2.25 DOTs, you can begin staking in these pools.

<div class="accordion accordion--colored">
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Have you waited for three eras from your initial nomination?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">When users nominate, the bond will not be assigned to a validator during the current era. Even if users bond their DOT, and nominators have been selected, the DOT isn’t assigned to a validator to receive the rewards. The next era, approximately a day later, if one of your nominations is in the active set and is not oversubscribed, then your DOT will be assigned to one of your active nominations and eligible for rewards. Rewards for this era should be paid two nomination periods later. </div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Is one of your nominations in the active set?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">Whether a validator is currently active can be seen in Ledger Live. Learn more <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018131260-Earning-Polkadot-DOT-bonding-rewards-in-Ledger-Live?docs=true" target="_self">here</a>. Are you one of the top 512 nominators? If a validator is oversubscribed, then only the top 512 nominators will be eligible for rewards. </div>

<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Have you recently added DOT coins to your bonded stake?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p>If you've ensured that your DOT stake exceeds the minimum nomination amount and you're still not receiving rewards, you might need to adjust your account position within the <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-staking-advanced#bags-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"bags-list" system</a>. Introduced in March 2022, the "bags list" system sorts nominating accounts into "bags" based on the amount of DOT staked. Only the top 22,500 accounts are factored into the reward algorithm, making the minimum staked amount required for rewards a dynamic figure (equivalent to 502 DOT coins as of November, 2023). If your DOT stake surpasses this minimum amount but you're not seeing rewards, it's possible that your account is not optimally positioned within its bag. As a result, your account may be inadvertently bypassed during the reward process. <strong>This is especially the case if you've recently added DOT coins to your bonded stake</strong>.
