<p><span>Although you can create a new recovery phrase for your device and accounts, you can't modify the words in an existing one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All accounts created in Ledger Live stem from a 24-word recovery phrase, which is generated on the Ledger device during setup. These words come from the </span><a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/bip-39-the-low-key-guardian-of-your-crypto-freedom"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BIP-39 protocol </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">- a standard put in place to safeguard private keys while allowing a practical means to record and store crypto. Once the recovery phrase has been confirmed on the device, those words will never appear again and should never be digitally stored or photographed. There is no way to modify or change these words. These words are effectively the master key to your crypto, and must be written down in the order they were generated. </span></p>

<p>Safeguarding your 24-word recovery phrase is one of the most important aspects to interacting with your crypto. Ledger Live will never ask for your 24-words. Please remember to correctly write down the 24 words, upon setup of your device, and make sure the words are spelled correctly and written down in the correct order. There is no way to modify or edit these words. </p></body></html>
