<h4 class="callout__title"><strong><em class="fa fa-info-circle">¬†</em>TLDR;</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The Merge will <strong>not</strong> have a noticeable impact on how you use your Ledger Ethereum account.</li>
<li>It's <strong>completely safe</strong> to keep your ETH, NFTs and ERC20 tokens in your Ledger Ethereum account <strong>before</strong>, <strong>during</strong> and <strong>after</strong> the Merge.</li>
<li><span>On the day of the Merge,<strong> Ledger Live will pause Ethereum services</strong> (directly on the app and also through the <strong>Discover</strong> section) for <strong>as little time as possible</strong>, while making sure the network is stable and <strong>safe to use</strong>.</span></li>
<li>Though <strong>you'll still be able to access your Ledger Ethereum account</strong> via third-party services like Metamask, it's strongly recommended to <strong>avoid</strong> high-value transactions and NFT transfers <strong>during</strong> the Merge.</li>
<li>Important events like the Merge are <strong>magnets for scammers</strong> trying to <strong>gain access to your 24-word recovery phrase</strong>. Beware! You do <strong>NOT</strong> need to update/upgrade/sync/migrate your Ethereum accounts with your 24-word recovery phrase leading up to the Merge.</li>

<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>What is the Merge?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p>The Merge is arguably the <strong>most important</strong> milestone in Ethereum's history to date. The Merge will change the way the Ethereum network <strong>comes to consensus</strong>. Consensus means agreeing on <strong>how new blocks are produced</strong> and <strong>ordered</strong> in the Ethereum blockchain.<br>Ethereum currently relies on <strong>proof-of-work (PoW)</strong> to create and order new blocks. After the Merge, POW will be "retired" and <strong>proof-of-stake (PoS)</strong> will become the new consensus mechanism. You can <strong>learn more</strong> about the Merge <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/#main-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>When will the Merge happen?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">The Merge is currently scheduled to happen around <strong>September 15, 2022</strong>. However, this date might be subject to slight changes. You can learn more <a href="https://bordel.wtf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Is it safe to keep my Ethereum assets in my Ledger Ethereum account during the Merge?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<strong>Yes</strong>, it's <strong>completely safe</strong> and <strong>recommended</strong> to leave your ETH, NFTs and ERC20 tokens in your Ledger Ethereum account during the Merge. The Merge won't affect your assets.</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Will I get an ETH2 coin airdrop after the Merge?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<strong>No</strong>, you <strong>won't</strong> get an airdrop. This is not how the Merge works. Instead, your Ledger Ethereum account in Ledger Live will display the <strong>exact same</strong> ETH, NFT and ERC20 balances as before.<br><strong>Beware of scammers</strong> trying to trick you into accepting <strong>malicious airdrops</strong>. More on this <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/security/#eth2-token-scam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Will the Merge make Ethereum cheaper to use?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<strong>No</strong>. Unfortunately, the Merge is not designed to make Ethereum cheaper to use.</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Will the merge make Ethereum faster?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<strong>Not really</strong>. In the current POW system, new blocks of transactions are added to the blockchain every ~13 seconds on average. After the Merge, new blocks will be added at a regular 12-second interval. Although this should translate into a very slight speed increase, <strong>it's unlikely the change will be noticeable</strong>.</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Will you continue supporting the legacy Ethereum POW network?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<strong>It's complicated</strong>. A minority of Ethereum miners <a href="https://decrypt.co/106409/prominent-chinese-ethereum-miner-wants-to-resist-merge-create-fork" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have expressed</a> their intention to <strong>continue mining on the legacy POW chain</strong> after the Merge. However, there is <strong>no guarantee</strong> that this will be the case.<br>Even if the POW chain survives the Merge, <strong>Ledger Live will not support</strong> <strong>it</strong> until we're <strong>absolutely sure</strong> it's <strong>safe</strong> to use and that it has attracted enough hashrate to be <strong>secure</strong>. This means that you <strong>won't</strong> be able to see your <strong>ETHW</strong> (ETHpow) balance and other Ethereum POW assets in Ledger Live after the Merge. You can <strong>learn more</strong> about Ledger's decision not to support Ethereum Pow <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/6707971245341?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Can I use my Ledger and third-party software to access my Ethereum POW account?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<strong>Yes</strong>, if Ethereum POW launches you will be able to access your Ethereum POW account(s) with your Ledger device and third-party software like Metamask. However, we <strong>strongly recommend</strong> <strong>avoiding</strong> transacting on Ethereum POW before the chain is safe to use. You can learn more <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/6707971245341?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</div>

<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Will the Ethereum network stop functioning during the Merge?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><strong>No</strong>, the Ethereum <strong>network</strong> will <strong>continue functioning</strong> throughout the Merge.</p>
<p>However, on the day of the Merge,<span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong> Ledger Live will pause Ethereum services</strong></span><span> (sending/receiving/staking ETH, tokens and NFTs, as well as Ethereum dapps in the </span><strong>Discover</strong><span><span> section) for as little time as possible, while making sure the network is stable and <strong>safe to use</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>Though you'll<strong> still be able to access your Ledger Ethereum account</strong> <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404366864657-How-to-access-your-Ledger-Ethereum-ETH-account-via-Metamask?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via third-party services like Metamask</a>, it's strongly recommended to¬†<strong>avoid</strong>¬†high-value transactions and NFT transfers¬†<strong>during</strong>¬†the Merge.<br>We will inform the community once the network has stabilized, <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://twitter.com/Ledger_Support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">follow us on Twitter for more information</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Will I need to "upgrade" my Ethereum account and assets before the Merge?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<strong>No</strong>, your Ethereum account and ETH, NFTs and ERC20 assets do <strong>not</strong> require an update/upgrade/migration/transfer/sync before or after the Merge.<br>However, it's possible that <strong>Ledger Live</strong> and the <strong>Ethereum app</strong> on your Ledger device might need an update around the time of the Merge but this update will <strong>NOT</strong> require using your 24-word recovery phrase. <a href="https://twitter.com/Ledger_Support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Follow us on Twitter</a> for more information.</div>

<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>I have 32 ETH, will I be able to solo-stake via Ledger Live immediately after the Merge?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<strong>No</strong>, we don't have an ETA for supporting solo-staking your ETH in Ledger Live after the Merge.<br>However, you're free to use your ETH to set up your own validator. A solo-staking guide is available <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/staking/solo/#what-is-solo-staking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>I am a solo-staker, will I be able to unstake my ETH after the Merge?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<strong>No</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you won‚Äôt be able to unstake until withdrawals are implemented via a </span><strong>future network upgrade</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (codename <strong>Shanghai</strong>). It could take </span><strong>a year (or more) after the Merge</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before the Shanghai upgrade is implemented and unstaking is enabled.</span>
