<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article provides information about how TRON (TRX) fees work.</span></p>
<h2 id="h_01HBBAA4T2F533PX06J0FKYN3H" data-id="f483a33d">What is Tron?</h2>
<p>Tron is a decentralized, multipurpose blockchain platform created by Justin Sun in 2014. It aims to create an operating system for smart contracts with scalable, fast, and low-cost transactions. Originally an ERC-20 token, Tron switched to its own network in 2018.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transaction fees on the Tron network are calculated based on energy, bandwidth, and transaction type. </span></p>
<h2 id="h_01HBBAA4T2Y914D50V9Y2G0MB3"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How Tron fees are calculated</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Normal transactions </strong>cost bandwidth points. Users can access the free daily bandwidth points (5000) or freeze their TRX to gain more. When bandwidth points aren’t enough, TRX will be given directly from the sending account. Required TRX is the number of bytes * 10 SUN. (1 TRX = 1,000,000 SUN).<br><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> Smart contracts</strong> cost energy but will also need bandwidth points to broadcast and confirm the transaction. The bandwidth cost is the same as above. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> Query transactions</strong> are free since they don’t cost energy or bandwidth.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, standard TRX transactions have very low fees compared to other networks and crypto assets. They exist but in a very low, nominal way. Tron smart contracts may be higher in fees depending on the overall bandwidth of the contract itself.</p>
