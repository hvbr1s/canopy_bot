<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CRO is the native coin of the Crypto.org and Cronos chains. The coin was originally known as Crypto.org Coin (CRO), but </span><a href="https://medium.com/cronos-chain/cro-is-now-cronos-bf103c257bd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in February 2022 it was renamed</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Cronos (CRO). For more information, check the <a href="https://www.ledger.com/coin/wallet/crypto-com-chain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cronos wallet page</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may find it difficult to distinguish between Crypto.com, Crypto.org chain, and Cronos chain. Below is a table that might help clarify it.</span></p>

<p>CRO is the native token of the Crypto.org chain, where it is referred to as Native CRO.</p>
</td>
<td>Cronos is an EVM-compatible layer 1 chain, where independent developers have deployed hundreds of DeFi, NFT and Web3 gaming applications.
<p>CRO is the native token of the Cronos chain, where it is referred to as CRC20 CRO.</p>

<p>The Native CRO (on Crypto.org chain), the CRC20 CRO (on Cronos), and the  ERC20 CRO (on Ethereum mainnet) are three cryptocurrencies that share the same token name, symbol, and value, but are actually different crypto assets using different chains.</p>
<p>Ledger Live supports all three versions of CRO.</p>
<h2>Managing CRO</h2>
<p>When managing CRO, for example withdrawing it from a crypto exchange into an account of your Ledger wallet, you need to make sure that you choose the correct blockchain network that will facilitate the transfer:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are intending to </span><strong>send CRO using the </strong><a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/8456545552541?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crypto.org Chain</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you will need to send it to an address that starts with ‘</span><strong>cro</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to </span><strong>send CRO using the Cronos chain</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you will need to use a</span><strong> ‘0x’ address</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to </span><strong>send CRO using the Ethereum mainnet chain</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you will also use a ‘0x’ address, but on the Ethereum network.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When sending Native CRO (Crypto.org) to a centralized wallet, it’s often required to add a </span><a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409603715217-What-is-a-Memo-Tag-?support=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memo tag</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the transaction.</span>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">When sending CRC20 CRO (Cronos) from a self-custodial wallet, you will incur some small transaction fees on the Cronos network (usually around one cent of a dollar). </span></li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When sending ERC20 CRO (Ethereum) from a self-custodial wallet, you will incur transaction fees on the Ethereum network. Keep in mind that the transaction fees on the Ethereum network can be significant.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Things to keep in mind:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When sending or receiving CRO, please double check the network. </span><strong style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><strong>Pro tip:</strong></strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Send a small amount first and verify that the transaction was received before sending larger amounts.</span></span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The value of CRO is the same no matter which chain is used.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">To stake on Crypto.org Chain, you need to use the Native CRO (Crypto.org), not CRC20 CRO or ERC20 CRO. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Crypto.com custodial app and the Crypto.com DeFi wallet support all three versions of CRO (Crypto.org, Cronos and Ethereum mainnet).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re holding ERC20 CRO on a crypto exchange other than Crypto.com, please follow their instructions for transferring and managing the tokens.</span></li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need to move tokens from one chain to another chain without going through a centralized exchange, you need to convert them from one format to another. This process is called </span><a href="https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/5645017-cronos-bridge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bridging</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>
