<h2>What's Ergo? </h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ergo represents the next step in the evolution of proof-of-work blockchain technology, combining Bitcoin’s ledger model with smart contract functionality. Ergo’s extended UTXO design is built to offer secure and robust tooling through the use of its native language, ErgoScript, and its inherent Sigma protocols that utilize non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ergo’s Autolykos v2 mining consensus algorithm is GPU friendly and ASIC resistant, allowing for anyone with consumer-grade GPU hardware to easily and effectively participate in securing the network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ergo blockchain launched in 2019 with no pre-mining or pre-allocation of any coins. The platform strives to be fair and accessible to all with an emphasis on building truly decentralized financial products and services. The ecosystem currently features the SigUSD stablecoin, ErgoMixer, a cross-chain DEX, and much more.
