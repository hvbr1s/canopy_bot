<p>Sometimes, it's necessary to downgrade to an older version of Ledger Live. This happens when you have an operating system that might not be compatible with a newer version of Ledger Live. A<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span>lthough it is technically feasible to downgrade, we do not recommend doing so. The reason we periodically release updates for Ledger Live is to address bugs and enhance security measures. Therefore, it is advisable to keep your Ledger Live updated to ensure the smooth functioning and security of your device. </span></span></p>
