<p>This article provides information about what to do when you encounter a loss of funds.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the world of crypto, the risk of losing funds is an ever-present concern. Fraudsters are out there 24/7 trying to find vulnerabilities that they can exploit and security should be your number one concern. At Ledger, we believe in true security, and security is not a term that we take lightly. While we are confident that Ledger devices are </span><a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/security/the-ledger-donjon"><span style="font-weight: 400;">designed to withstand all known vectors of attack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, scammers are continually finding ways to use social engineering, phishing, and fraud tactics to trick crypto users to separate them from their hard-earned money. When used correctly, your Ledger is a fortress, but it ultimately can’t stop you from opening the gates.</span></p>
<h2>Before you start</h2>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li>Make sure to <strong>update Ledger Live</strong> to the latest version via <a href="https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link</a>.</li>
<li>Open Ledger Live and connect your Ledger device to <strong>My Ledger</strong> to ensure that your Ledger device is running the <strong>latest firmware version</strong>.</li>
<li>Please be sure to clear your cache in Ledger Live. Learn more about how to do that <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012207759-Solve-a-synchronization-error?support=true" target="_self">here</a>. </li>
</ul>
<h2>First things first</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, before assuming funds are lost, we suggest you make sure that </span><a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404389606417-Download-and-install-Ledger-Live?docs=true"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ledger Live is up to date</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and please try </span><a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404381846929-Clear-cache-in-Ledger-Live?support=true"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clearing the cache</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Ledger Live as well. Then, check your balance/deposits and see if they align with your expectations. If not, get a second opinion from a blockchain explorer or some other wallet visualizer tools like Rainbow or Zerion (located in the Discover tab in Ledger Live). Remember, Ledger Live’s opinion about your blockchain balance is reliable, but ultimately it’s the blockchain itself that is your source of truth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have confirmed the loss of funds, you should be able to isolate the transactions that moved those funds out of your account. If there are transactions you didn’t authorize, it’s likely that you have been compromised somehow.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did an unauthorized transaction occur?</span></h2>
<div class="accordion accordion--colored">
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Someone obtained your physical device and knew its PIN</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">An attacker got access to your physical Ledger device while simultaneously knowing its PIN code. They would be able to unlock the device and sign transactions to themselves or another party.</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>An attacker was able to obtain your 24-word seed phrase</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">With your recovery phrase, an attacker has the ability to drain all of your accounts across all blockchains without any input needed from your Ledger device. Some ways people inadvertently lose control of their recovery phase are by taking a photo of it, uploading it to cloud storage like iCloud or Google Drive, saving it in a file on their computer, or using it to set up a hot wallet like Metamask. Your Ledger is protecting an encrypted copy of your seed phrase inside of it with military-grade cryptographic hardware, and remember that it’s your job to make sure your recovery phrase stays offline, and is never entered into a computer, into a phone, or shared with anyone or any application asking for it. In addition to accidentally leaking your seed phrase digitally, phishing scams are rampant in this space as well. Attackers are constantly trying to trick you into giving your recovery phrase away to them by masquerading as a legitimate website or application, or posing as a helpful support person and asking you for it directly. If you find that your assets have been transferred from multiple accounts simultaneously, or across multiple blockchains, it’s likely an attacker has a copy of your recovery phrase. <strong>If this is the case that you’re in, consider all accounts associated with this 24-word recovery phrase to be compromised</strong>, and the only thing you can do is evacuate any remaining value out of those accounts and into safe accounts associated with a new recovery phrase. Once you take care of that, the next step is to think back to which mechanism an attacker may have used to get you to disclose your seed phrase or obtain it off of your computer.</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>You were tricked into signing a transaction that results in a different outcome than the one you expected</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">For instance, a type of phishing scam involves putting up a website that appears to be minting an NFT, but in reality, tricks you into signing a transaction that sends an NFT from your account instead. Signing transactions without understanding what they’re doing is what Ledger calls “blind signing” and is <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/cryptos-greatest-weakness-blind-signing-explained" target="_self">crypto's greatest weakness</a>. Ledger devices by default have blind signing disabled to help protect users from this risk, though advanced users can turn this protection off if they choose. If this is the case that you're in, your account is not entirely compromised. Only the assets you’ve transferred to an attacker or approved to be taken remain at risk. Sites like Etherscan let you <a href="https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker" target="_self">audit your account</a> and see if you have any lingering approvals left from the attack. If in doubt, get in touch with Ledger support to help you through this process.</div>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do I do if I’ve been scammed?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public blockchains, by design, do not have any authority that can freeze or retrieve funds, close accounts, or otherwise keep people from their assets. Ledger can't reverse transactions, no one can.  The only way to get your money back is to locate the criminal who took it and compel them to send it back, which is a task that is only within the authority of law enforcement agencies and the legal system. If you have not already, we suggest that you file a criminal report with your local police or law enforcement authority. This is worth repeating: the only way to retrieve stolen funds is to bring the criminal who stole it to justice. Full stop.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What can Ledger do for me?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web3 scams hold the whole industry back, and Ledger will attempt to respond to requests from investigating officers to the best of our abilities. To be clear, Ledger only has access to the same public blockchain transaction information that everyone else has access to, but sometimes local law enforcement agencies aren’t well equipped to know how to obtain or interpret this data, and we do our best to make ourselves available to point investigations in the right direction. This is offered to investigators at Ledger’s discretion and is purely an act of goodwill. It is not an offer to lead or assist with investigations. The responsibility for the investigation and all actions in the process MUST be initiated by the police or the investigating agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, our support team is happy to provide our knowledge to guide you in this process and can help answer your questions. For certain types of attacks, it’s possible to repair the security holes and get your account back into a secure place. Ultimately though, it’s up to the victim to contact authorities and pursue an investigation.</span></p>
