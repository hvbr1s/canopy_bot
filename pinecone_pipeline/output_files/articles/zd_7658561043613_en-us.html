<h4 id="h_01HAS55QFB8TJ0WQGNKKDQKK72" class="callout__title"><strong>What's the APY for staking with Ledger by Figment?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">APY (annual percentage yield) refers to the growth rate of your NEAR stake as rewards* are applied to it. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The return for staking with Ledger is in line with the Near Protocol nominal yield </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">minus a commission fee paid to Ledger and Figment for providing the staking service.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that staking rewards are not guaranteed as they depend on a number of factors including the network’s performance and node uptime.</span></li>
