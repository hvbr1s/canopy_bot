<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Kiln is a protocol staking platform that allows you to lock your ETH to fund an Ethereum validator and get ETH rewards in return directly </span><span style="color: #0e101a;">through Ledger Live. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">This tutorial describes how to <strong>solo-stake</strong> your ETH with Kiln which requires</span> you to deposit <strong>at least 32 ETH</strong>. <span>You can leverage solo staking with validator-as-service provider Kiln through Ledger Live.</span></p>
<p>Don't have 32 ETH? You might want to consider <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/14637664463133?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pooled-staking</a> your ETH with Kiln instead. However, please note that f<span style="color: #0e101a;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">or legal reasons, US-based users cannot use the pooled staking service through Ledger Live. </span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><em class="fa fa-info-circle"> </em>In the case of solo staking, the time for your stake to activate and begin getting rewards depends on the queue of Ethereum validators awaiting activation. This can usually span </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">days to weeks</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, during which your ETH will be inaccessible and won't accrue rewards.

<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>What is solo staking?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">With solo staking, you're locking your ETH to fund a validator and get ETH rewards. On the other side, with pooled and liquid staking, the service provider takes your ETH deposits, stakes them, and gives you rewards.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"></span></span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>I have more than 32 ETH to deposit. Is solo staking the only option I can use?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">No, you can also leverage pooled staking or combine solo and pooled staking — stake a multiple of 32 ETH with solo staking and stake the remaining ETH with pooled staking. You can learn more about pooled-staking <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/14637664463133?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</span></p>

<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>What happens to my ETH when I stake it?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Your ETH is deposited into the Eth2 deposit contract and associated with a validation key that Kiln generates for you. This validation key is then used to instantiate a validator deployed on Kiln infrastructure. The validator performs on-chain duties on the Ethereum Beacon Chain, namely attestations and block proposals. For this activity, rewards are accrued to your withdrawal wallet.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"></span></span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Who can withdraw the staked ETH?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p>Only the wallet you use to issue your deposit can be used to withdraw your stake and accrued rewards. Kiln or any other party cannot do that. This means you must ensure you retain control of the wallet you use to deposit your stake.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>How can I withdraw my rewards?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Here's how to do it:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span style="color: #0e101a;">In the Kiln dashboard, navigate to </span><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">Rewards</span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">. You'll see the list of the validators you're using.</span>
</li>
<li><span style="color: #0e101a;">Click on the three dots next to the validator you want to withdraw the rewards from.</span></li>
<li>
<span style="color: #0e101a;">Click </span><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">Withdraw available rewards</span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">. </span>
</li>
<li><span style="color: #0e101a;">Open the Ethereum app on your device.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #0e101a;">Review and approve the transaction with your Ledger device.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Once the transaction has been confirmed, the rewards will land in your wallet.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"></span></span></p>

<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Why are my rewards from solo staking claimed without me initiating the process?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Following the April 12th, 2023 and Shapella upgrade, the Ethereum protocol automatically checks the validator balances above 32 ETH and sends rewards to the Ledger Live staking smart contract address. Then you can withdraw your rewards.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"></span></span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>What address is used for withdrawals?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">The withdrawal address is managed by the Ledger Live staking smart contract. From that address, you can claim and withdraw rewards to your wallet.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"></span></span></p>

<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>I have requested to exit from staking but my validator is still active and receiving rewards. Why does this happen?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">This is expected. The process of a validator exiting from staking takes various amounts of time, depending on how many others are exiting at the same time. Validators continue to participate in the network and receive rewards until they are fully exited.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"></span></span></p>

<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>When can I withdraw my rewards on staked ETH and my initial stakes?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">With solo-staking, there are two components to rewards as described </span><a href="https://www.kiln.fi/post/the-merge-and-its-impact-on-eth-staking-rewards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a><span style="color: #0e101a;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Execution-layer rewards are immediately withdrawable.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Consensus-layer rewards will only be available to withdraw when the Capella upgrade described in the previous question will be ready. You can withdraw rewards accumulated on the execution layer from your Kiln dashboard.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gBqeWaB7hU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s a tutorial</a><span style="color: #0e101a;"> showing how to withdraw rewards from Ledger Live. You'll be able to claim your original 32 ETH batches stakes and consensus layer rewards after the Shanghai upgrade on Ethereum, which is planned for 2023.</span></p>

<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>What are the risks associated with staking and how do you mitigate them? Where can I find audit reports?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">When you stake with this service, Kiln will operate the validator(s) on your behalf. If these validators are incorrectly operated, it is possible for a portion of the funds you have staked to be </span><em><span style="color: #0e101a;">slashed</span></em><span style="color: #0e101a;">, meaning they are destroyed by the protocol.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">This is very rare in general and has never happened in Kiln’s history of operating Ethereum validators; Kiln's infrastructure is purpose-built to reduce this risk. You should however be aware that the risk is not 0.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Two smart contracts introduce an additional risk:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0e101a;">The deposit contract takes the incoming ETH and deposits it into the Beacon chain deposit contract.</span></li>
<li>
<span style="color: #0e101a;">The withdrawal contract retrieves your rewards and sends them back to you minus a commission sent to Kiln/Ledger. Only you can trigger this withdrawal and it can only go to your </span><em><span style="color: #0e101a;">depositor's address</span></em><span style="color: #0e101a;">.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Both contracts were jointly developed with Ledger and are continuously audited by Halborn and Ledger Donjon. Please get in touch with Kiln to receive the Halborn audit report. Please read </span><a href="https://www.kiln.fi/post/monitoring-ethereum-staking-infrastructure-at-scale" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this article</a><span style="color: #0e101a;"> to learn more about Kiln monitoring, slashing, and downtime mitigation.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"></span></span></p>

<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Does staking with Kiln trigger a taxable event?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">No token is issued when you use this product. Your ETH isn't exchanged for another token but deposited into the Beacon Chain deposit contract to fund your validator(s). This doesn't constitute a taxable event in most jurisdictions (UK, US, and others).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">For informational purposes, please consult your tax advisor for confirmation.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"></span></span></p>

<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>What validator clients does Kiln run?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Kiln runs a combination of Prysm and Teku validator clients.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"></span></span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>What happens if Kiln goes out of business?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">In that case, validators' keys would be given to the owners or Ledger to switch infrastructure providers. This would minimize downtime, prevent slashing, and make sure validators only run in a single instance.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true"></span></span></p>

<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To access your rewards, head over to the Discover section of Ledger Live and select the Kiln app. Once inside the app, you'll find the <strong>Rewards</strong> tab at the top right-hand side of the app window.</span></span></p>
