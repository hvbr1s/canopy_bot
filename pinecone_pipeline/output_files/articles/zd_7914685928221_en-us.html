<h2>Managing crypto with Ledger Stax</h2>
<div class="accordion accordion--default">
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Do I lose my crypto if I lose my Ledger Stax?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span>Don't worry, you'll be able to access, manage, and retrieve your crypto as long as your Secret Recovery Phrase is safe and accessible only to you. Simply get another Ledger Stax or any other Ledger and recover access to your assets using the Secret Recovery Phrase.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Why should I use Ledger Stax rather than an exchange or a software wallet to store my digital assets?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span>Software wallets store private keys on systems that are connected to the internet, making them susceptible to all kinds of attacks. Holding your crypto on an exchange means entrusting the private keys to a third party and not having any control over your funds. Ledger Stax stores your private keys offline on a Secure Element chip, and provides full isolation between the keys and your computer/smartphone to give you complete control over your assets. You're the only one in control.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Can someone steal my funds if they have access to my Ledger Stax?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span>Even if someone steals your Ledger Stax, they won't be able to access it without knowing your PIN. Entering the wrong PIN three times in a row will automatically reset your Ledger Stax to its factory settings.</span></p>
