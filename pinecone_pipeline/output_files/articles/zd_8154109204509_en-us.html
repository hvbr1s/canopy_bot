<p>This article aims to provide users with some recovery phrase best practices to avoid losing funds while using products in the Ledger ecosystem. </p>
<h2>Best practices:</h2>
<ol>
<li data-renderer-start-pos="107">Have a backup of your recovery phrase on metal devices. We sell the <a href="https://shop.ledger.com/products/cryptosteel-capsule-solo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cryptosteel Capsule</a>, the <a href="https://shop.ledger.com/products/the-billfodl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Billfodl</a>, and the <a href="https://shop.ledger.com/products/cryptotag-zeus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cryptotag Zeus</a>. These devices are specifically designed to withstand fire or water damage. We believe that these types of storage devices are the safest way to your 24-word seed phrase. <br><br>
</li>
<li data-renderer-start-pos="160">Have a recovery phrase backup in two secure locations. This way, if one of the phrases gets lost, stolen, or damaged, you have a backup in a different place.<br><br>
</li>
<li data-renderer-start-pos="217">Have a "<a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033804094-Set-up-a-backup-device?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hot backup</a>" Nano device with the same recovery phrase as the primary Nano. To purchase a backup back, click <a href="https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-backup-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> to learn more. <br><br>
</li>
<li data-renderer-start-pos="334">Run a <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007223753-Recovery-Check?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recovery check</a> right after setting up your Nano with a new recovery phrase. Doing this will ensure that you have the correct seed phrase before loading new crypto on it. <br><br>
</li>
<li data-renderer-start-pos="334"><span>Don't reset or restore your Nano before confirming that the recovery phrase words on the Nano device matches the words on your backup sheet. Run a <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007223753-Recovery-Check?docs=true">recovery check</a> to confirm that they match.</span></li>
