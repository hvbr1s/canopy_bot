<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storing your crypto with a Ledger device gives you full control over your private keys. It keeps them offline, isolated from the Internet, and away from online threats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, that’s not the case with software wallets which are often a honeypot for hackers and different types of malware attacks.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Malicious attacks are growing in number and sophistication</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attacks targeting software wallets and attempting to trick users are becoming more and more common.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One example is an </span><a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/7101057682461-Crypto-address-switcher-malware?support=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">address replacement attack</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can lead to loss of funds if you’re not careful when signing a transaction. Malware can infect your PC or smartphone and modify your address to trick you into sending funds to a fraudulent attacker's address instead of yours—you could paste your own wallet address and malware would change it to the attacker’s address. Often, the beginning and the end of an address match, so most people wouldn’t notice the change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is that your Ledger device keeps the receiving/sending address accurate. With that in mind, you should consider your Ledger device display as the only source of truth.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tips on staying safe</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trust your device. Software apps, phones, and computers can be hacked or infected with malicious programs. Rely on your Ledger device to review transaction details. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before signing a transaction, check carefully if it matches the one displayed in a software wallet. Verify details such as an address, amount, and fees.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regularly scan your PC for malware.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure that you have the latest version of antivirus software installed. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid unlicensed software and sites that look suspicious.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re an advanced user, you can</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> verify the authenticity of the Ledger Live binary installation. </span><a href="https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/lld-signatures" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more</span></a>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always send a small amount first. If the funds are successfully received, you can send larger amounts.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Double-check the recipient’s address. For example, you can double-check an exchange deposit address with the recipient through SMS, email, or a messaging app.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verify that the recipient address, amount, and fees displayed in a software wallet match the ones displayed on the screen of your Ledger device.</span></li>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verify that your deposit address displayed in a software wallet matches the one displayed on the screen of your Ledger device. Keep in mind that addresses displayed in software wallets can be manipulated.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wait for multiple confirmations before accepting a payment. For Bitcoin transactions, six confirmations are recommended. </span></li>

<p><strong>Note:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sometimes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ledger Live will detect suspicious activity and inform you about it. You’ll see the message </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mismatch between the copied address and the one in the clipboard</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In this case, immediately cancel the transaction and do the full scan of your PC.</span></p>
<p><strong>Unverified addresses</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Ledger Live can provide receiving addresses without a Ledger device. However, these addresses provide insufficient security. If you choose to use unverified addresses, you do so at your own risk.</span></p>
