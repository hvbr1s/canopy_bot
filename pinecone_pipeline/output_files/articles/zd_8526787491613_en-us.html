<p>When you hold crypto on an exchange, it's the exchange that creates and manages accounts on your behalf and controls your private keys.</p>
<p>With Ledger, you create your own crypto accounts and control the private keys. </p>
<p>In this article, we explain step-by-step how you can withdraw crypto from KuCoin to your Ledger wallet.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HD4TE462719YAQRF97EYG967"><span style="color: #434343;">Log in to your KuCoin account</span></h2>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://www.kucoin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KuCoin</a> and log in to your account.</li>
<li><font color="#0e101a"> Scroll down to the and select <strong>Withdraw</strong>.<br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/14282165400989" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-19 at 2.09.22 PM.png" width="626" height="231"><br><br></font></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li><span style="color: #0e101a;">Go through the Google Verification/2FA process if it asks you to.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #0e101a;">Select the coin you want to withdraw.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Now it’s time to generate your Ledger deposit address. But before doing so, you first need to select the correct network. </span></p>
<div class="callout callout--primary">
<h4 id="h_01HD4TE462V35N2AAHXXSXAY4V" class="callout__title">What is a network?</h4>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The network is another term for blockchain. Crypto assets run on networks. In fact, some crypto assets can run on multiple networks. Before withdrawing your crypto from KuCoin, you need to know which network it runs on. You should withdraw your crypto to the Ledger wallet using a supported blockchain. <span style="color: #0e101a;">Learn more about KuCoin and its <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/articles/8171070953373-I-sent-assets-via-KuCoin-and-can-t-see-them?support=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">withdrawal system here</a>. </span></span></p>
</div>
<h3 id="h_01HD4TE462MDVFGX0M2BA32HT7"><span style="color: #666666;">Selecting the correct network</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Its very important to select the correct network when withdrawing funds from KuCoin. </span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/14282196000669" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-19 at 2.15.15 PM.png" width="558" height="428"></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">You should </span><span class="wysiwyg-underline" style="color: #0e101a;">always double-check that the correct network is selected before withdrawing your crypto. The network selected on KuCoin needs to match the one selected in the Ledger Live app.</span><span style="color: #0e101a;"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">A simple rule of thumb is to </span><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">always select the coin's native network</span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">. For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">BTC</span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;"> → Bitcoin network.</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">ETH</span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;"> → Ethereum network.</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">BNB</span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;"> → Binance Smart Chain network.</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">ETC</span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;"> → Ethereum Classic network.</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">DOT </span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">→ Polkadot network.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Things, however, can get complicated. For example, with native coins of certain blockchain platforms, you need to be extra careful. Similarly, <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/articles/8950985607325-How-to-manage-stablecoins-USDC-DAI-USDT-with-Ledger-Live?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some stablecoins</a> can operate across a variety of blockchains.</span></p>

</div>
<ol>
<li>Open the Ledger Live app.</li>
<li>Navigate to the left sidebar menu and click <strong>Receive</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the same crypto you selected on the exchange.</li>
<li>Select the same network you selected on KuCoin. If the network isn't listed, then Ledger Live doesn't support it yet.</li>
<li>Connect and unlock your Ledger device. Your deposit address will be displayed.</li>
<li>
<span style="color: #0e101a;">QR code will appear. Click </span><strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">Copy address</span></strong><span style="color: #0e101a;">.</span>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="h_01HD4TE4625WZXVQB5MZDFT9F5"><span style="color: #434343;">Verify your deposit address</span></h2>
<div class="callout callout--primary">
<p><span style="color: #434343;">The Ledger Live app can provide deposit addresses without a Ledger device. These addresses, however, are unverified and may not be secure. If you choose to use unverified addresses, you do so at your own risk.</span></p>
</div>
<p>⚠️<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Trust your device</span>: only trust the display of your Ledger device. <span style="color: #0e101a;">Now it’s time to verify that your deposit address is correct and matches the one displayed on your device.</span><span style="color: #434343;"></span></p>
<p>Compare the address you copied from the Ledger Live app with the one displayed on your Ledger device. Does your Ledger device display the same deposit address as the Ledger Live app? <span style="color: #434343;"></span></p>
<p>Now that you've verified the address, paste it into the KuCoin <strong>Wallet Address</strong> field and confirm that it matches the one in Ledger Live. <span style="color: #434343;"></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">All set.</span></p>
<h2 id="h_01HD4TE462EXN68RWH78GCE6B7"><span style="color: #434343;">Finalize withdrawal</span></h2>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Send a small amount first and verify that the transaction was received before sending larger amounts. </span></p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Paste the deposit address in the <strong>Wallet Address</strong> field in KuCoin. Ensure that the address you pasted is the same as the one that was displayed on your Ledger device. </li>
<li>Click <strong>Withdraw</strong>.</li>
<li>Go through the 2-FA authentication if required.</li>
</ol>
<p>Wait until the transaction is processed. Blockchain networks take different amounts of time to process transactions.<span data-preserver-spaces="true"></span></p>
