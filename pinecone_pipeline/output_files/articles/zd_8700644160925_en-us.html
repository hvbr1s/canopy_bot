<p>This article explains how to revoke token approvals and permissions of a smart contract on Ethereum.</p>
<p>If you signed a <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/smart-contract-functions-essential-red-flags-to-know-about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">malicious smart contract</a> or if the signed smart contract was exploited, you can revoke your approvals and permissions. You also can revoke the approvals if you don't want to interact with a specific smart contract.</p>
<h2>What is a smart contract? </h2>
<p>Smart contracts are programs that are stored on the blockchain and run when the predetermined conditions are met. Smart contracts are used to simplify and automate the execution of the agreement between the parties. They also reduce the time for execution and exclude or minimize the involvement of intermediaries. You can <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/what-is-a-smart-contract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learn more</a> about smart contracts on Ledger Academy.</p>
<h2>What are token approvals and permissions?</h2>
<p>Token approvals and permissions are granted by you to decentralized applications (smart contracts and protocols) to access tokens and NFTs in your crypto wallet. Approvals can apply to ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 tokens and NFTs. </p>
