<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>What is an EVM network?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">

<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>I withdrew some EVM tokens from an exchange but they're not showing in Ledger Live</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">It's very likely that you provided the correct address but selected the wrong network for your withdrawal. <em>For example - sending ETH via the Binance Smart Chain network:</em><br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/8940127620765" alt="mceclip0.png" width="396" height="337"><br><br>A good rule of thumb is to always select the native network for the selected coins. For example: select the Ethereum network for ETH and ERC20 tokens, select the Solana network for SOL, Polygon for MATIC, etc.<br> </div>
