<p><span>This article provides insight on the issue of Monero (XMR) GUI being inaccurately flagged as a virus by some antivirus programs on Windows operating systems. </span></p>
<p>The Ledger Monero app is developed in collaboration with the Monero community. The Monero GUI is developed and supported by the <a href="https://getmonero.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monero community</a>.</p>
<h2 data-renderer-start-pos="349">Why is the GUI being falsely flagged?</h2>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="136"><a href="https://web.getmonero.org/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monero GUI</a>, a popular software for managing Monero cryptocurrency, has <strong>recently been flagged as a virus by some antivirus programs. This false flagging is caused by the presence of a miner within the software.</strong></p>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="349">A miner is a program that is used to validate transactions on a blockchain network and create new blocks. In return for their work, miners are rewarded with new coins. While mining can be a legitimate way to earn crypto, it can also be used for malicious purposes, such as creating a botnet to mine without the knowledge or consent of the affected parties.</p>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="707">In the case of Monero GUI, the miner is not activated by default and must be explicitly turned on by the user. However, even with the miner activated, it is not recommended to use Monero GUI for mining. This is because the software is not optimized for mining and may consume a significant amount of system resources, leading to slow performance and potential damage to the computer.</p>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="1092">In conclusion, the reason Monero GUI is falsely flagged as a threat by some antivirus programs is because it contains a miner, which can be used for malicious purposes. While the miner must be explicitly activated by the user, it is not recommended to use Monero GUI for mining due to performance and legal concerns. Instead, it is best to use dedicated mining software or cloud-based mining services.</p>
