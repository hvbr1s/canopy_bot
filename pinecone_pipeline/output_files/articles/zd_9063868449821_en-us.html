<p>This article answers the question “Is it safe to disconnect by unplugging a Ledger device from a computer/phone?”.<br>When it comes to disconnecting Ledger devices from their PC or smartphone, many users confuse them with USB flash drives. <br>The ''Safely remove hardware" guidelines, such as those for Windows or Mac, don't apply to Ledger devices. You can physically remove a Ledger device from your computer/smartphone without any special steps.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unplugging a Nano S or Nano S Plus powers the device off.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unplugging a Nano X, will not power it off but PIN-lock it.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When it comes to disconnecting a Ledger device from a smartphone via Bluetooth or USB, you can physically disconnect the cable from your device or, in case of a Bluetooth connection, turn the device off.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To avoid errors in Ledger Live, we still don't recommend disconnecting Ledger devices during transaction approvals or installation/uninstallation of Nano apps.</span></strong></p></body></html>
