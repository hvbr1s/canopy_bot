<p><span>This article outlines the various types of 'execution reverted' errors and provides troubleshooting guidance for each.</span></p>
<h2 id="h_01HCFFGWZRWNBGAHRBRRW0RGJC">Adding an account failed with a 'Execution reverted (-32000)' or '-32000: execution reverted' error</h2>
<p><span>Attempts to add Ethereum (ETH) or Polygon (MATIC) accounts may sometimes result in '<strong>execution reverted (-32000)</strong>' or '<strong>-32000: execution reverted</strong>' errors in Ledger Live. This is a known issue and we're working as fast as we can to address it.</span><br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/13302755387421"><br><br></p>
<h2 id="h_01HBGGPE98WY74SQMSEBSYVD89">Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
<li>While we're working on a fix, consider managing your Ethereum (ETH) and Polygon (MATIC) accounts with the Ledger Live <strong>mobile</strong> app which you can download <a href="https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.<span></span>
</li>
<li>
<span>If the issue persists,</span> you can keep managing your Ethereum (ETH) and Polygon (MATIC) accounts safely by temporarily connecting your Ledger device to third-party applications. For desktop users, <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404366864657-Connect-your-Ledger-to-MetaMask?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MetaMask</a> and <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409801559569-Set-up-and-use-Rabby-wallet-to-access-your-Ledger-Ethereum-ETH-account?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rabby</a> are good options, while mobile users can utilize <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/7031144634141-Rainbow-me?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rainbow.me</a> with their Nano X device.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01HCFFHT0HY1XMQFADYSN9WMZ4">My transaction failed with an [execution reverted] error</h2>
<p><span>In certain situations, your transaction may fail, displaying an <strong>[execution reverted]</strong> error in the block explorer. This error commonly occurs with transactions involving smart contract interactions, such as sending ERC20 or BEP20 tokens or NFTs, or utilizing decentralized apps (dapps) on blockchains that employ the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), including Ethereum (ETH), Polygon (MATIC), Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and others.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/14113806620829"></p>
<div class="callout callout--warning">
<p><span>Please be aware that the [execution reverted] error, occurring during failed transactions, is <strong>distinct</strong> from the '<a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/9259413674781?support=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">execution reverted (-32000) error</a>'. The latter typically arises when adding an Ethereum or Polygon account to Ledger Live as described in the previous section.</span></p>
</div>
<p><span>The [execution reverted] error indicates a transaction that couldn't be executed due to unmet conditions in the underlying smart contract. Essentially, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)—the engine powering smart contract execution—reverts the state to its condition prior to the transaction attempt.</span></p>
<p><span>It's important to understand that even though the transaction was only <strong>partially</strong> executed before being reverted, <strong>it will still consume network fees (gas)</strong>, as the network compensates miners or validators for processing the failed transaction.</span></p>
<p><span>There are multiple reasons why a transaction might fail with an [execution reverted] error, often arising when a transaction violates the business logic set within the contract. If you encounter an execution reverted error, consider <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4423020306705?support=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reaching out to Ledger Support for assistance</a>. Additionally, if the error occurs while using a decentralized app, contact the team responsible for the app.</span></p>
