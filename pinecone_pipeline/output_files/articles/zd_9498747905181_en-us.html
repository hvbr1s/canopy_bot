<h2>Bitcoin transaction is pending</h2>
<p>If you just sent the transaction and it shows as not confirmed and pending, then it is normal.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">It takes some time for the transactions to get confirmed on the blockchain and depending on the <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/articles/360021039173-Choose-network-fees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fees</a> you selected, it may take from 1 minute to several hours. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Network congestion also has a big impact on how long you need to wait. If many people are doing transactions right now, it will increase the waiting time.</p>
<h2 class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">What should I do if my transaction is pending?</h2>
<p>If you just made the transaction, <strong>please be patient and wait for 2-3 hours</strong> and <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/articles/4404381846929-Clear-cache-in-Ledger-Live" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clear cache</a> in Ledger Live and check the status again.</p>
<p>If it stays<strong> not confirmed</strong> for more than 3 hours, it is possible you set up too low network fees during the sending process. <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/articles/360021039173-Choose-network-fees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more about network fees</a>.</p>
