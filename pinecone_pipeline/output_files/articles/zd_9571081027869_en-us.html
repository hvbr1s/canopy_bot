<p>This support article provides information to users who encounter a "T is not a function, R is not a function" or "A is not a function" error message while using Ledger Live.</p>
<h2>Before you start</h2>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li><a href="https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Be sure to have the most updated version of Ledger Live.<span> </span></a></li>
<li>Update the firmware<span> </span>on your Ledger device <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002731113" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nano S</a> / <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4445777839901?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nano S Plus</a> /<span> </span><a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013349800" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nano X</a>.</li>

<p><span>If you receive an error message saying "t is not a function," it's likely that the issue may be related to a proxy (work computer) or VPN causing interference with the connection to Ledger Live. To resolve the problem, we recommend trying the following steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Switch to a different internet source:</strong> If you are using a Wi-Fi network, try connecting to a different network or use a mobile hotspot instead. Sometimes, certain networks can block or interfere with Ledger Live's connectivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Disable proxy settings:</strong> If you are using a proxy server to connect to the internet, try disabling it and then launch Ledger Live. Proxy settings can sometimes interfere with the application's ability to communicate with the blockchain. <span>In some cases, when using a work computer, a proxy may cause disruptions in communication with Ledger Live.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Check your VPN.</strong> If you have a VPN enabled, activate <strong>Experimental networking</strong> in Ledger live by going into <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Experimental features</strong>. If the problem persists, turn off your VPN.<strong><br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/9714020527005"></strong> <br><br>
</li>
<li><span><strong>Try using Ledger Live mobile</strong> instead. If you continue to encounter the "t is not a function" error message while using Ledger Live on your computer, you can try using the mobile app instead. The Ledger Live mobile app is available for both iOS and Android devices and can be downloaded from the respective app stores. </span></li>
