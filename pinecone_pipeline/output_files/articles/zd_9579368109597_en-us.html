<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>What is Ledger Recover?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span>Ledger Recover is an ID-based key recovery service that provides a backup for your Secret Recovery Phrase. If you lose or don't have access to your Secret Recovery Phrase, the service allows you to securely restore your private keys using a Ledger device.</span></p>

<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Why do I need Ledger Recover?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span>You’re responsible for storing your Secret Recovery Phrase. While this setup makes you enjoy all the benefits of self-custody and complete control over your assets, it also makes you solely responsible for their protection. Ledger Recover is designed for users who want to add an enhanced layer of security in case their Secret Recovery Phrase is lost or when they can't access it.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Who has access to my wallet with Ledger Recover?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span>In short, only you can access your wallet. When you subscribe to Ledger Recover, a pre-BIP39 version of your private key is encrypted, duplicated and divided into three fragments, with each fragment secured by a separate company—Coincover, Ledger and EscrowTech. Each of these encrypted fragments is useless on its own. When you want to get access to your wallet, 2 of the 3 parties will send fragments back to your Ledger device, reassembling them to build your private key.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Does Ledger Recover compromise the security of my private key?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p>No, it doesn’t. Ledger Recover service follows the same principle as signing the transaction on a blockchain—securely and only with your permission. No access to your private key was made to enable Ledger Recover to work.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">To better understand this, let's go back to the basics and see how hardware wallets—which can be described as signing devices—work. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Hardware wallets have two primary purposes: to safeguard your private key and sign transactions on the blockchain. To sign the transactions, wallets need to access your private key. They can't sign transactions otherwise.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Ledger devices protect your private key with a Secure Element, a technology that has been battle-tested and used in the finance industry for 30 years, from storing passwords and fingerprints to processing contactless payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Ledger's Operating System allows access to the private key stored within the Secure Element, but only after you manually approve and confirm it. </span><span><span style="color: #0e101a;">To learn more about how the process works behind the scenes, read </span><a href="https://twitter.com/P3b7_/status/1659187049331654658" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this explanation</a><span style="color: #0e101a;"> from Ledger's CTO Charles Guillemet and check out </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7WjuxE6K5w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his interview about wallet security</a><span style="color: #0e101a;">. For a technical explanation of how Ledger Recover operates, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/P3b7_/status/1658580819030441990" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see Charles Guillemet's tweet</a><span style="color: #0e101a;">.</span></span></p>

<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>Why don't you build a second operating system without Ledger Recover?<span><span style="color: #0e101a;"></span></span></strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">In terms of security, there is no difference in having this part of the code in the operating system or not. In reality, it is up to the user to choose if they want to activate the feature or not. We have no doubt that implementing this feature in our firmware does not increase the threat model or the attack surface area.  </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Our OS implements plenty of cryptographic primitives. These primitives manipulate secrets. They all must be properly implemented and this is Ledger’s job. Finally, our contract with users is that whenever the OS touches any secret, the user is prompted to give his consent.</span><span><span style="color: #0e101a;"></span></span></p>

<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>What would happen to my Ledger Recover subscription and related data if one of the companies goes out of business?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p>To restore your keys, you need two out of three fragments that are securely kept by the three independent and trusted companies. If one of the companies holding a fragment shuts down, you will still be able to restore your keys until another trusted company replaces it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>What should I do with my recovery sheet once I subscribe to Ledger Recover?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span>Ledger Recover can restore your private keys to your device, but it can't provide you with your Secret Recovery Phrase. If you have any other physical/digital copies of your recovery sheet or Secret Recovery Phrase, it's your responsibility to secure them. Keep in mind that anyone who obtains your Secret Recovery Phrase can access your wallet. </span></p>

<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>What is Coincover?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span>Coincover provides the gold standard in digital asset security, addressing the most significant barrier to mainstream adoption: trust. If wallet access is lost, Coincover offers encrypted and military-grade storage for retrieving the key.</span></p>

<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>What if I have a passphrase-protected wallet? Is it covered by Ledger Recover? </strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p>The passphrase feature is available on all Ledger devices and allows you to create an additional password tied to your Secret Recovery Phrase. For each Secret Recovery Phrase, a different passphrase leads to a new set of private keys and accounts.<span></span> The Ledger Recover service, if used, does not backup your passphrase. <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005214529-How-to-set-up-a-passphrase-?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn how to set up a passphrase</a></p>

<p><span>You can subscribe to Ledger Recover without a Ledger device, but you will need it to activate and use the service.</span></p>

<div class="accordion__item">
<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>What is the difference between Ledger Recover identity verification and KYC?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p>Identity verification is not the same as KYC. Identity verification inherently collects much less information compared to KYC. To go through Ledger Recover identity verification you need a valid, government-issued document and be the rightful owner of that document. KYC involves ID verification but it can also include revenue information, record of criminal activity, citizenship check, etc. Again, Ledger Recover uses identity verification, not KYC.</p>

<div class="accordion__item-title"><strong>How are the three fragments of my Secret Recovery Phrase secured?</strong></div>
<div class="accordion__item-content">
<p><span>Ledger Recover is provided by Coincover. When you subscribe to the service, your Ledger device after your approval will encrypt the entropy of your Secret Recovery Phrase—a string of random 1s and 0s from which your Secret Recovery Phrase is computed. The encrypted entropy is fragmented into three pieces within the Secure Element chip. Your Ledger device will send the fragments to 3 separate and independent companies that will store them using Hardware Security Modules.</span></p>
