<p>Starting with Ledger Live <strong>2.54.0</strong> and Ledger Live mobile <strong>3.16.1</strong>, 0-value transactions will be automatically hidden in Ledger Live.</p>
<p>Hiding these transactions serves as protective measure against <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/8473509294365-Beware-of-address-poisoning-scams?docs=true">address poisoning scams</a>.</p>
<p><span>Although it is possible to deactivate this protection by accessing <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounts</strong> and turning off the <strong>Hide token transaction when the value is 0</strong> option, it is advisable to <strong>keep it enabled</strong>.</span><br><br></p>
