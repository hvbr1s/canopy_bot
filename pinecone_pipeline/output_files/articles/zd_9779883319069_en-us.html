<h2>About the issue and how to fix it</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span>If you encounter a pre-check error ("max attempts of 10 was reached for the request with last error being: TRANSACTION_EXPIRED") while attempting to send a transaction with HBAR on the Hedera network, it could be <strong>due to incorrect date and time setting on your computer or mobile device</strong>. The error message indicates that the sum of the transaction's valid start time and duration is less than the current consensus time on the Hedera network. </span></p>

<p>The error message indicates that the sum of the transaction's valid start time and duration is less than the current consensus time on the Hedera network. This could occur if your device's clock is out of sync with the network's clock.</p>
<p>To resolve this issue, please <strong>ensure that your device's date and time settings are correct</strong>. You can do this by checking your device's system settings and updating them as needed. Once you have corrected your device's clock, try sending the transaction again.</p>
