<p><span>Stake 2.0, a recently introduced stake model on the TRON network, has been deployed to mainnet on April 7, 2023. This new model decouples resource delegation from staking, eliminating the need for unstaking when delegating or undelegating bandwidth and energy. For more details on Stake 2.0, please refer to <a href="https://coredevs.medium.com/what-is-stake-2-0-e04f59b948a6">this article</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>Following the launch of Stake 2.0, staking can only be conducted via the Stake 2.0 API. Any TRX assets that have been staked under Stake 1.0 will continue to exist and can only be retrieved using the 1.0 unstake API which is no longer supported in Ledger Live.</span></p>
<h2 id="h_01HAS0MMFWD961NFPMCSM6YTPD"><span>Impact on Ledger users</span></h2>
<p><span>Currently, Ledger Live <strong>does not offer support for Stake 2.0</strong>. As of version <strong>2.57.0</strong>, Ledger Live has also discontinued the previous Stake 1.0 API, with plans to integrate Stake 2.0 in the future.<br><br><img src="https://support.ledger.com/hc/article_attachments/10484385250077"><br><br>This lack of support does <strong>not</strong> impact the accrual of rewards* on <strong>existing</strong> staked TRX balances. </span></p>
<p><span>To stake <strong>new</strong> TRX balances and manage <strong>current</strong> staked ones, users should utilize a third-party wallet like <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403786119569-Connect-your-Ledger-to-Tron-with-TronScan?docs=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TronScan</a>.</span></p>
